But food must feed the soul too. That\u2019s why we call good food a \u201chearty meal\u201d. To feed the heart and the soul and keep them healthy and happy, why not pick that Universal favorite, chicken? It\u2019s protein that\u2019s filled with wholesome goodness, especially when you cook it with care. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together some outstanding Heart Healthy Chicken Recipes, just for you.<\/p>\n<p>Chicken is one of the best low-fat protein choices. In fact, a Harvard School of Public Health study published in the prestigious Circulation journal showed that eating one serving of poultry as opposed to one serving of red meat can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by 19%!<\/p>\n<p>Besides being good for the heart, chicken is also rich in calcium and phosphorus (for improved bone health), as well as selenium (a rich antioxidant, that can help reduce inflammation everywhere in the body)<\/p>\n<p>Chicken, when prepared with care, can make for a healthy and delicious meal (instead of the trans-fat-loaded bomb that we call Fried Chicken!) Here\u2019s how you can turn the world\u2019s favorite protein into a health champ.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tips_To_Making_Every_Heart_Healthy_Chicken_Recipe\">Tips To Making Every Heart Healthy Chicken Recipe<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose organic, grass-fed chicken.<\/li>\n<li>You can eat chicken with skin on, as long as you cook it in the right oils and heart-healthy fats. Avoid deep frying chicken skin for crackling.<\/li>\n<li>Saturated Fats are good for you. Pick coconut oil, olive oil, ghee, or grass fed butter to cook your chicken.<\/li>\n<li>Best ways to cook your chicken are broiling, poaching, roasting and grilling.<\/li>\n<li>If you are worried about your heart health, remove all trans-fats from your diet.<\/li>\n<li>Cut out all processed chicken products like sausages, frankfurters and ham from your diet. If it comes pre-packaged, it contains additives and preservatives you want to avoid. Same holds true for all canned foods.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid cooking with high sodium sauces for heart health.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are our favorite heart-healthy chicken recipes to share with your loved ones Valentine\u2019s Day!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"1_Mediterranean_Chicken_Skewers\">1.

And while it\u2019s still cold out, warm your hearts with this amazing Chicken Breasts With Tomato-Corn Salsa recipe that is easy to put together on a busy day, especially if you have pre-planned and done the prep-work in advance. Tomato and corn salsa is a wonderfully fresh, easy-to-make topping for lean grilled chicken. While this hot tomato salsa is good with any grilled meat, it is particularly delicious with grilled chicken breasts.<\/p>\n<p>What makes this Chicken Breasts With Tomato-Corn Salsa a heart-friendly recipe?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grilled chicken breasts are great for cardiovascular health as these are lower in fats when compared to red meat<\/li>\n<li>Olive oil is associated with significant improvements in the biomarkers for coronary heart diseases (CAD)<\/li>\n<li>Tomatoes are a very nutritional food source rich in anti-oxidants, vitamin A and C,\u00a0folic acid\u00a0and beta-carotene. They are also rich in a substance called lycopene, a bright red substance that reduces heart disease risk factors.<\/li>\n<li>Corn is full of fiber, and an ear of corn has about the same number of calories as an apple and less than one-fourth the sugar. In other words, it is heart-friendly!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This recipe serves 4.<\/p>\n<h4>Ingredients:<\/h4>\n<p>For the Chicken:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>4 skinless, boneless Chicken Breasts cut into halves<\/li>\n<li>2 tbsp. fresh Lemon juice<\/li>\n<li>2 tbsp. Olive Oil<\/li>\n<li>2 tsp ground Cumin<\/li>\n<li>2 tsp dried Oregano<\/li>\n<li>1 tbsp. coarse black pepper<\/li>\n<li>Salt, to taste<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For the Salsa:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 fresh hot Green Chili Pepper<\/li>\n<li>400g Tomatoes, seeded and finally chopped<\/li>\n<li>250g Sweetcorn, freshly cooked or thawed frozen<\/li>\n<li>3 Spring Onions, finely chopped<\/li>\n<li>1 tbsp. chopped fresh Parsley<\/li>\n<li>2 tbsp. chopped fresh Coriander leaves<\/li>\n<li>2 tbsp. fresh Lemon juice<\/li>\n<li>2 tbsp.

Add chicken to the dish and turn to coat. Cover and leave it to marinate for at least 2 hours, or chill overnight.<\/li>\n<li>To make the salsa, char the chili skin either over a gas flame or under the grill. Leave to cool for 5 minutes and then carefully discard the charred skin. If you want a mildly hot flavor, discard the seeds.<\/li>\n<li>Chop the chili very finely and place in a bowl. Add all the remaining salsa ingredients and mix well.<\/li>\n<li>Remove the chicken from the marinade and season lightly.<\/li>\n<li>Cook it on a ridged grill pan over medium heat until both sides are evenly browned, about 3 minutes on each side.<\/li>\n<li>Serve the hot grilled chicken breast with the chili salsa.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>NUTRITION\u00a0(per serving):<\/h4>\n<p>450 cals, 23 g fat, 80 mg cholesterol, 414 mg sodium, 23 g carbs, 27.9 gm dietary fiber, 43 g protein<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"3_Lemon_Chicken_with_Guacamole_Sauce\">3.

Try our Lemon Chicken with Guacamole Sauce! The avocado sauce is unexpectedly good with the grilled chicken and beats all other accompaniments you\u2019ve ever tried before!<\/p>\n<p>What makes the Lemon Chicken with Guacamole Sauce a heart-friendly chicken recipe?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heart-healthy chicken breasts are a must-add to your grilling repertoire. By grilling this white meat rather than shallow or deep frying it, you keep the natural saturated fat in it intact.<\/li>\n<li>Extra-virgin olive oil promotes cardiovascular health, being high in phenolic antioxidants<\/li>\n<li>Avocados are an excellent source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fat that is easily burned for energy, while being low in fructose.<\/li>\n<li>Tomatoes have two key nutrients that have a big impact on heart health: lycopene and potassium. Lycopene may lower LDL, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, and keep blood from clotting, which lowers stroke risk. Potassium\u00a0helps lower <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/metformin-side-effects\/\">blood pressure<\/a> by taking some of the sodium out of your body, and by relaxing the walls of your blood vessels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This recipe serves 2.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ingredients\">Ingredients:<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>For the Chicken:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 skinless, boneless Chicken Breasts, halved<\/li>\n<li>Juice of 1 lemon<\/li>\n<li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin Olive Oil<\/li>\n<li>2 cloves of Garlic, crushed<\/li>\n<li>2 large Tomatoes, cored and cut in half<\/li>\n<li>Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste<\/li>\n<li>Chopped fresh coriander leaves, for garnishing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For the Guacamole Sauce:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 ripe Avocado<\/li>\n<li>2 tbsp. low-fat Sour Cream<\/li>\n<li>2 tbsp. fresh Lemon Juice<\/li>\n<li>Pinch of salt<\/li>\n<li>Pepper to taste<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Method:<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Combine the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl.<\/li>\n<li>Arrange chicken breasts in a shallow dish and pour over this marinade. Let it stand for 1 hour at room temperature, or cover and chill overnight.<\/li>\n<li>For the sauce, cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Scrape the flesh into a food processor. Add the sour cream, lemon juice and salt and blend until smooth. Add a couple tablespoons of water to get the desired consistency. Transfer into a bowl and adjust seasoning if required. Set aside.<\/li>\n<li>Preheat the grill or heat a ridged frying pan. Remove chicken from the marinade and add to the pan. Cook on both sides until browned, turning often, until the chicken is cooked through. This can take between 8 to 10 minutes.<\/li>\n<li>Meanwhile arrange the tomato halves cut side up, on a baking sheet and season lightly. Grill until hot and bubbling, about 5 minutes.<\/li>\n<li>To serve, put chicken breast, tomato half and a dollop of the guacamole sauce on each plate.
