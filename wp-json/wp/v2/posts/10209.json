While the exact cause of CFS is still not known, there are three main reasons why women are more vulnerable to CFS when compared to men.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Hormonal_Changes_During_Menopause\">Hormonal Changes During Menopause<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A study undertaken by the North American Menopause Society revealed a link between menopause and CFS. The hormonal changes taking place in the body during menopause is&nbsp;one of the main reasons behind the emergence of CFS in women. Additionally, estrogen dominance in women can lead to stress, which results in greater vulnerability to CFS. On the contrary, testosterone, a ,vital male hormone, is said to protect men from CFS. For this reason, the likelihood of men getting CFS increases with age when testosterone levels start declining.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Women_are_More_Prone_to_Stress\">Women are More Prone to Stress<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Stress is one of the contributing factors to CFS. In a study undertaken by researchers at Vall d\u2019Hebron University, it is evident that women are more prone to stress&nbsp;and pain as compared to men. Additionally, studies show women are doubly prone to stress-related diseases like generalized anxiety, PTSD, depression, and irritable bowel syndrome.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Complex_Immune_System_in_Women\">Complex Immune System in Women<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Women have a complex immune system, which protects them from infections. But the same immune system can make it difficult for women to recover once they are infected, as compared to men. The higher number of women in post-infectious mononucleosis triggered-CFS suggests that men recover faster than women. A delayed recovery results in women getting more stressed, which can eventually lead to CFS.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The exact causes of chronic fatigue syndrome are yet to be identified, it is evident that women are more susceptible to CFS as compared to men due to stress, hormones, and their complex immune systems.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":84,"featured_media":19197,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[139],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>3 Natural Reasons Why Women Are More Vulnerable to CFS | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Hormonal changes during menopause, ability to deal with stress, &amp; a complex immune system are the three reasons women are more vulnerable...\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/chronic-fatigue-syndrome\/women-are-more-vulnerable-to-cfs\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Here&#039;s Why Women Are More Vulnerable to CFS Than Men\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Did you know that women have a higher chance of being afflicted by CFS as compared to men?
