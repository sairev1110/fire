By 2050, the number of Americans suffering from the condition are predicted to increase from 48 million to 88 million. Age is a major risk factor for the condition. The condition is likely to occur in people post the age of 60, but it could also occur earlier depending on your lifestyle. We look at the various controllable and non-controllable risk factors of this disorder.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Risk_Factors_for_AMD_You_Cannot_Control\">Risk Factors for AMD You Cannot Control<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Genetics\">Genetics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Family history or genetics play a significant role in developing the condition. Studies suggest there are 20+ genetic factors that are associated with the risk of developing&nbsp;it.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Race\">Race<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Caucasians or white people are more likely to develop this disorder as opposed African-Americans and Hispanics. However, this doesn\u2019t mean it cannot affect people from other ethnicities.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Gender\">Gender<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Women are more likely to develop the condition than men. A study in 2010 reveals 65% of cases were observed in women as compared to 35% cases in men.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Early_AMD\">Early AMD<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Early AMD increases your chances of late AMD, which can lead to vision loss. People with early AMD in both eyes have a 14% chance of developing late AMD in at least one eye after 10 years.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Risk_Factors_for_AMD_You_Can_Control\">Risk Factors for AMD You Can Control<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Smoking\">Smoking<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>People who smoke are at twice the risk of developing the condition than non-smokers. It is considered as the single-most important modifiable risk factor in developing the condition.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Lack_of_Exercise\">Lack of Exercise<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Poor exercise habits contribute to an overall unhealthy lifestyle and increased chances of the disorder&nbsp;as well. A 2009 study co-relates the decreased risk of developing the condition with increased physical activity.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Unhealthy_Food_Choices\">Unhealthy Food Choices<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A diet that is high in processed and packaged foods is an obvious risk factor for developing this disorder. Always try and keep your food palate tilted more towards farm fresh fruits and vegetables. Dietary supplements can also help in slowing down&nbsp;the condition.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"High_Blood_Pressure_Cholesterol\">High Blood Pressure &amp; Cholesterol<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels can also contribute to this eye disorder. Keep them within normal ranges at all times to prevent the risk of AMD.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By 2050, the number of Americans suffering from AMD are predicted to increase from 48 million to 88 million.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":19427,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[64],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Risk Factors of AMD You Can &amp; Cannot Control | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Genetics, race, &amp; gender are AMD risk factors that cannot be controlled.
