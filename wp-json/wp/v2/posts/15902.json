Instead, Intermittent Fasting (IF) is a timed approach to\nlosing excess body fat, and keeping it off in the long run. Unlike other\ntraditional diets that restrict calories or food groups, intermittent fasting\nbecomes a lifestyle change that involves cycling between periods of eating and\nshort-term fasting. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are intermittent fasting, you are\nfree to eat most foods (with exceptions like added sugar and highly processed\nfoods) and enjoy a varied diet, but over a shorter window of time. Simply put,\nIF gives you the freedom to eat almost whatever you like and still lose weight,\nas well as keep it off for good! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/intermittent-fasting-guide-health-benefits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"How, you ask?  (opens in a new tab)\">How, you ask? <\/a>One way is that eating during a shorter period of time helps control intake of calories to keep unwanted weight off. But that\u2019s not the real reason. The core reason is that IF helps reduce the amount of insulin secreted in the body. Insulin is our fat storage hormone and the shorter the time it is active for in our blood, the more the fat burnt and the greater the weight &nbsp;loss. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ways to practice intermittent fasting but the most popular ones are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The 16:8 Method:<\/strong> The most popular way to practice IF, it encourages 16 hours of fasting with 8 hours eating window. Skip breakfast, and eat two big meals between say 12 noon to 8pm.<\/li><li><strong>The 5:2 or Alternate Day Fasting:<\/strong> This method promotes alternate day fasting on two days of the week, wherein a person consumes just 500-600 calories on those two days. Eat normally the other 5 days of the week.<\/li><li><strong>Eat-Stop-Eat:<\/strong> This involves fasting for 24 hours on two non-consecutive days of the week. For example: fast from breakfast on Tuesday until breakfast on Wednesday.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"How_Does_Intermittent_Fasting_Affect_Hormones\"><strong>How Does Intermittent Fasting Affect Hormones<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Intermittent\nfasting targets stored body fat. When you don\u2019t eat over a period of time, the\nbody makes integral changes to use up stored fats to release energy. And to\nmake this happen, there are crucial changes in metabolism and hormone activity\n&#8212; all of which benefit you in the long run. This is why IF works so well for weight\nloss in chronic diseases that are caused by hormonal imbalances, like Diabetes\nType 2, cholesterol issues and PCOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Insulin:<\/strong> When we eat, insulin levels\nrise. Similarly, when the body is fasting, insulin levels drop down to\nfacilitate fat burning.&nbsp; <\/li><li><strong>HGH:<\/strong>\nFasting increases levels of HGH or Human Growth Hormone 5 times, which promotes\nfat loss while aiding muscle gain.<\/li><li><strong>Noradrenaline:<\/strong>\nDuring fasting, the nervous system sends norepinephrine or noradrenaline to fat\ncells to break them down. This breakdown of stored body fat into free fatty\nacids that fuels the body results in weight loss.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>IF promotes hormonal changes in the body that actually boosts fat burning to encourage weight loss. This is why IF is far more successful that other conventional calorie-restrictive diets when it comes to losing excess body fat without losing muscle mass. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"The_6_Ways_Intermittent_Fasting_Helps_You_Lose_Weight\"><strong>The 6 Ways Intermittent Fasting Helps You Lose Weight <\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Calorie_Restriction\"><strong>Calorie Restriction <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"187\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Calorie-Restriction.webp\" alt=\"weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-21146\"\/><figcaption>Calorie Restriction <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Intermittent fasting helps control your\ncalorie intake by its very design. By limiting the eating window, you end up\neating fewer calories, without the hassle of counting or measuring calories.\nSince all the three IF protocols involve periods of fasting, you end up\nskipping meals, which means lesser overall calorie intake. But remember: even\ndiet plans that ask you to eat six small meals a day achieve this calorie\nrestriction. The crucial difference is that IF positively influences the way\nyour hormones behave over a longer term, which the many-small-meals-a-day\nweight loss programmes don\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S193152441400200X\" target=\"_blank\">review study<\/a> conducted at University of Illinois at Chicago found that IF leads to significant weight loss and is a great alternative to controlled calorie restrictive diets. Subjects lost up to 0.75kg per week with alternate-day fasting method, while those who tried 16:8 method lost about 0.25kg per week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Lowered_Insulin_Levels\"><strong>Lowered Insulin Levels<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"187\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Lowered-Insulin-Levels.webp\" alt=\"weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-21148\"\/><figcaption>Lowered Insulin Levels<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Intermittent fasting has a two-pronged\neffect on insulin function. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One \u2013 it improves insulin sensitivity\nthrough increased adiponectin levels which can help weight loss as well as\ninsulin function in diabetics. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two &#8211; fasting helps reduce fasting insulin\nlevels that signals your body that it\u2019s time to burn stored fat (instead of\nglucose) to release energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15640462\" target=\"_blank\">study<\/a> conducted at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, LA&nbsp;found that alternate day fasting increased fat oxidation (or fat burning) while also reducing insulin levels by 4%.

IF can help\ndecrease levels of LDL and VLDL (bad cholesterol).

Intermittent fasting helps in decreasing oxidative stress and\ninflammation throughout the body. This in turn leads to the body feeling\ncomfortable with burning stored fat and losing weight. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lowered inflammation is the key to long-term weight loss, along with reducing risk to metabolic syndrome, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4516560\/\" target=\"_blank\">Review studies<\/a> have found that IF promotes human metabolic health by significant improvements in inflammatory markers that boost weight loss while boosting longevity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Promotes_Ketosis\"><strong>Promotes Ketosis<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"706\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Promotes-Ketosis.webp\" alt=\"weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-21152\"\/><figcaption>Promotes Ketosis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With\nthe popularity of the Keto diet, most of us know that ketosis helps achieve\nfast weight loss. <em>(Note: Ketosis is a metabolic sate when the body does not\nhave enough glucose for energy.

There\u2019s no counting calories,\nthere\u2019s no hard-and-fast rules as to what you can eat (beyond not bingeing on\nprocessed foods and added sugar) and it even allows you to have a normal social\nlife, wherein you can enjoy lunch or dinner out with friends and family. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eating 2 meals instead of 3 meals makes it a lot simpler for you to stick to a healthy lifestyle. And as we all know, the best diet for you is one you can stick to for life! Intermittent Fasting is one of those diets that let you enjoy benefits of improved long-term health and easy weight management, without a whole lot of fuss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Start_your_day_with_the_right_beverage\"><strong>Start your day with the right beverage <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"144\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Start-your-day-with-the-right-beverage.webp\" alt=\"weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-21153\"\/><figcaption>Start your day with the right beverage <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If the idea of skipping breakfast sounds too daunting, start the day with a beverage. Sip on a cup of bulletproof coffee (black coffee with added butter or coconut oil), unsweetened green tea or a mug of bone broth during fasting window to keep from becoming hangry (hungry and angry).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Follow_a_low-carb_diet\"><strong>Follow a low-carb diet<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"176\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Follow-a-low-carb-diet.webp\" alt=\"weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-21154\"\/><figcaption>Follow a low-carb diet<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>While intermittent fasting doesn\u2019t come with any hard and fast rules, it\u2019s a good idea to follow a low-grain carb diet during feeding window. A diet low in grain carbs but high in healthy fats and proteins will keep you feeling satiated for longer and also make it easier for your body to transition into ketosis when in fasting state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Stay_away_from_processed_foods\"><strong>Stay away from processed foods<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"144\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Stay-away-from-processed-foods.webp\" alt=\"weight loss\" class=\"wp-image-21155\"\/><figcaption>Stay away from processed foods<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>What you eat is still important! Even though you may be starving at the end of your fasting window, it is important to steer clear of processed and junk foods. These will do no favours to your waistline and will only stall your weight loss journey. Eat whole foods that offer you a variety of nutrients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Consistency_is_the_key\"><strong>Consistency is the key<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all diet protocols, it takes time for your body to get used to intermittent fasting.
