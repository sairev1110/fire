If the saying is true, wouldn\u2019t it be great to be cool and crisp like a cucumber? Or in fact more like the refreshing cucumber water that is one of the healthiest and detoxifying drinks! The benefits of cucumber water are not just for people who have digestive issues but also for people who suffer from bone brittleness, bloating and more issues. Let&#8217;s look at a few benefits of cucumber water.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"8_Benefits_Of_Cucumber_Water\">8 Benefits Of Cucumber Water<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Keeps_Muscles_Healthy\"><strong>Keeps Muscles Healthy<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Silica is an important nutrient to keep the connective tissues healthy in the muscles. Cucumber is a rich source of silica when consumed regularly. Just add a few slices of cucumbers in a water bottle and keep on sipping it so that this necessary nutrient is provided to your muscles all day long.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Keeps_Bloating_At_Bay\"><strong>Keeps Bloating At Bay<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Bloating happens due to an excessive water content in the body. The benefit of cucumber water is that it helps in flushing out excess water, waste, and toxins from the system. Cucumbers are diuretic in nature, thus triggering the kidneys to produce more urine.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fights_Free_Radicals\"><strong>Fights Free Radicals<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Free radicals, which are unstable substances in the human body, can lead to chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, and heart disease. These free radicals can be destroyed by antioxidants. The peel of cucumber is a rich source of vitamin C, beta-carotene, and several flavonoid compounds which all are antioxidants that help in destroying free radicals. The benefit of cucumber water is that it helps the body in assimilating the antioxidants quickly.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Helps_in_Hydration\"><strong>Helps in Hydration<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/dangers-dehydration-dont-see-coming\/\">dangers of dehydration<\/a> are well known. A minimum of 8 glasses of water per day is needed for the optimal functioning of the human body. Water is good for your skin, your mental health and your overall well being. Cucumber water means extra hydration for the body. It helps in maintaining your body temperature and even assists cardiac functioning.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Provides_More_Energy\"><strong>Provides More Energy<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Coffee and tea may be all-time favorite beverages but they don&#8217;t give the required energy to your body the way cucumber water does. The benefit of cucumber water is that it provides energy and also flushes out unnecessary toxins from the body to avoid lethargy and improve focus.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Maintains_Blood_Pressure\"><strong>Maintains Blood Pressure<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>High sodium (salt) intake is one of the major reasons why blood pressure shoots up. The excess salt retains fluids in the body, which in turn increases blood pressure. Potassium is an important element for balancing the amount of salt that is held back by the kidneys.\u00a0 Cucumber water contains high levels of potassium. As a result, regulating blood pressure is one of the key benefits of cucumber water.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Relieves_Pain\"><strong>Relieves Pain<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Traditionally cucumber was used as a remedy for headaches because its seeds are cooling and diuretic. The juice is used as a nutritive and as a demulcent in anti-acne lotions according to studies. Apart from that, one of the major benefits of cucumber water is that it contains flavonoids, which are anti-inflammatory substances. Cucumbers also have tannins, which have known to reduce pain.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Great_For_Skin\"><strong>Great For Skin<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Only used cucumber slices at spas? Now drink them! The benefits of cucumber water are not only limited to silica for great skin but also extend to the antioxidants, which are good for anti-aging and supple skin. Acne marks or redness can also be reduced by simply washing the face with cucumber water.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Has_Anti-_Inflammatory_Properties\"><strong>Has Anti- Inflammatory Properties<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Another major benefit of cucumber water is that it helps in cooling down the inflammatory response in the body. Cucumber extract helps in reducing undesirable inflammation by preventing the activity of pro-inflammatory enzymes.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Healthy_Alternative_To_Sodas\"><strong>Healthy Alternative To Sodas<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Sodas and canned juices do more harm than good for the body! In spite of being aware of their health risks, many people drink them because plain water can be boring to drink all the time. However, cucumber water isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a good source of vitamins and minerals the body needs. Along with that, there are plenty of creative cucumber water recipes that can provide more antioxidants as well as vitamins to the body, while also being fun to drink.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Quick_and_Fun_Cucumber_Water_Recipes\">Quick and Fun Cucumber Water Recipes<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20619\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Benefits-of-Cucumber-Water-2nd-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20619\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20619\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Benefits-of-Cucumber-Water-2nd-image.webp\" alt=\"Quick and Fun Cucumber Water Recipes\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20619\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Quick and Fun Cucumber Water Recipes<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"Delicious_Cucumber_Lemon_Water\">Delicious Cucumber Lemon Water<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ingredients Needed<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lemon Juice (from one big lemon)<\/li>\n<li>One tall glass of water<\/li>\n<li>4-6 slices of cucumber<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Put the slices of cucumber &amp; lemon juice in a glass full of water and stir it properly.
