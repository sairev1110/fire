Add to that the hype around \u2018Clean Eating\u2019 which can easily overwhelm any diabetic with all the restrictions it poses. It\u2019s true that living well with diabetes type 2 starts with the right diet plan. However, it doesn\u2019t have to be an everyday challenge to figure out what to eat to keep your blood sugar levels balanced. Let&#8217;s look at what should be a good diet plan for diabetics.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Basics_Of_A_Good_Diabetes_Diet_Plan\">The Basics Of A Good Diabetes Diet Plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"A_Mix_of_Nutritious_Natural_Foods\">A Mix of Nutritious &amp; Natural Foods<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Let me simplify this. A good type 2 diabetes diet plan ensures that you get:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adequate amount of fiber-rich whole grains<\/li>\n<li>Fresh fruits and vegetables<\/li>\n<li>Organic lean cuts of organic meats, and<\/li>\n<li>A good amount of healthy fats from sources like fatty fish, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/benefits-of-avocados\/\">avocados<\/a>, coconut oil and grass-fed butter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The basics of a diabetes diet plan are simple.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/hidden-sugars-smoke-out-those-villains-hiding-in-plain-sight\/\">Smoke out all hidden sugars<\/a> from your diet, cut back on carbohydrates, add more fiber to your diet and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/healthy-fats-why-everyone-must-eat-them\/amp\/\"> choose the fats you eat wisely<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Minimum_Carbohydrates\">Minimum Carbohydrates<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s imperative that you understand it\u2019s not just sugars that are responsible for elevated blood sugar.\u00a0All carbohydrates get broken down into sugars. For this reason, choosing the right source of carb is an essential part of your diabetes diet plan. Vegetables and fruits are the right sources of carbs for any diabetic. Refined carbohydrates with a high glycemic index are best avoided, as the body readily transforms them into simple sugars. When choosing grains, complex carbohydrates are better choices. Brown rice, quinoa, barley, steel-cut oats, whole-wheat breads, buckwheat, and millets are some examples of complex carbohydrates.<\/p>\n<p>Here at Sepalika, we highly recommend a LCHF or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/low-carb-high-fat-lchf-diet-diabetes\/\">Low Carb-High Fat diet <\/a>to reverse diabetes, coupled with intermittent fasting. Together, these help increase insulin sensitivity and keep blood sugar stable all through the day.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Space_Out_Your_Meals\">Space Out Your Meals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>We cannot stress on this point enough. Stick to three meals a day at the most, and aim for a 10-12 hour fasting period between dinner and breakfast. Forget that hogwash about eating frequently to keep your blood sugar in check. Your body NEEDS a break between the three meals of the day, so it can get sensitive to insulin again. Let your body burn fat for energy between meals.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Learn_To_Use_Good_Fats\">Learn To Use Good Fats<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>At this point, we would like to add that changing your diet to reverse diabetes is a lifelong commitment, and it\u2019s not as difficult as it may sound. We get it &#8212; we all have been eating way too many carbs for decades (<em>probably the main reason Diabetes Type 2 is a global epidemic now!<\/em>). And so we cannot imagine a life that asks us to cut back on these. But it can be done. It takes a little getting used to. But if you make sure that your diabetes diet has the good fats your body needs, it will respond by learning to use fats, instead of craving sugar.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"3_Easy_Options_To_Move_To_A_Diabetes_Diet_Plan\">3 Easy Options To Move To A Diabetes Diet Plan:<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Now that we have run through the basics of a good diabetes diet plan, let\u2019s discuss how you can start eating the right way. Once you understand the basic rules, there are 3 ways you can make the transition to a healthier eating style. Do consult a dietician to discuss your specific health conditions and arrive at the best eating strategy for you.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Option_1_Design_Your_Plate\">Option 1: Design Your Plate<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is a simple strategy that will ensure you fill up your plate with the right kind of carbohydrates. Recommended by the American Diabetes Association, it revolves around designing your plate by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fill up one-half of your plate with any non-starchy vegetables of your choice. Examples are\u00a0lettuce, broccoli, zucchini, spinach, carrots, beans, asparagus, and tomatoes.<\/li>\n<li>Next, fill one-quarter of your plate with a lean protein of your choice. Examples are\u00a0poached salmon, tuna, grilled chicken or turkey breast and lean pork chops.<\/li>\n<li>Fill the last quarter of your plate with fibre-rich whole grains. We recommend brown rice, quinoa, barley, steel-cut oats and millets. You could swap grains for starchy vegetables if you\u2019d like to try a grain-free meal. Choose from sweet potatoes, corn, peas, winter squash and dried beans.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Option_2_Carbohydrate_Counting\">Option 2: Carbohydrate Counting<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>We don\u2019t support the idea of calorie counting at all. Not all calories are designed equal. You cannot equate 200 calories coming from a grilled chicken breast to those coming from a bag of chips. Period.<\/p>\n<p>But for those who are new to eating a low-carb diet, the idea of counting carbohydrates does make sense. Why? Because all carbs break down into glucose, so they have the greatest impact on your blood glucose level.<\/p>\n<p>So it makes sense to keep a close eye on your carbohydrate intake to keep your blood sugar at healthy levels.<\/p>\n<p>While the American Diabetes Association still recommends 135\u2013230 grams of carbs per day for diabetics, we believe this number is way too high. Limiting your carbohydrate intake to 30-50gm per day is a good way to stabilize blood sugar and help lose weight, which highly benefits diabetics. It also helps improve heart health markers in people with diabetes, and forms the basis of a LCHF diet.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15767618\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<\/a> following a small group of obese patients with type 2 diabetes found that a low-carbohydrate diet (only 21grams\/day) followed for 2 weeks resulted in much improved 24-hour blood glucose profiles, insulin sensitivity, and hemoglobin A1c. It also led to decreased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels. So low-carb diets do make A LOT of sense.<\/p>\n<p>While carbohydrate counting may sound tricky in the beginning, soon you will get a hang of it. When starting this method, you will need to invest in kitchen weighing scales to get the portions right. Once you do this for a few weeks to months, you will intuitively be able to eat the right amounts of carbohydrates (from good, fiber-rich sources!) without having to measure out portions for every meal.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Option_3_Following_Glycemic_Index\">Option 3: Following Glycemic Index<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Following the Glycemic Index (GI) is another method to stabilize blood sugar levels through the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/simple-diabetic-diet\/\">diabetes diet<\/a>. What this method does is that it ranks all carbohydrates based on the way it affects blood sugar levels. Foods with low GI will not cause a spike in blood sugar, while those that are high on the GI list will. For your reference, a GI value of 70 or higher is considered high, 56\u201469 is considered medium, and 55 or lower is considered low.<\/p>\n<p>While the GI method may sound easy in theory, it is not without its flaws. It fails to consider all variables that raise blood sugar, such as portion sizes and the cooking method. It also doesn\u2019t pay any mind to the nutritional content of the foods. Many foods that are low in GI may not be the healthiest choice (hello potato chips!), whereas fruits which are high in GI (like watermelon) can easily be incorporated into a healthy diabetic diet plan.<\/p>\n<p>A better idea is to instead check the Glycemic Load &#8212; which takes into consideration both the GI of a food and the amount of carbohydrate\/portion size.<\/p>\n<p>Read this article on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/staying-healthy\/choosing-good-carbs-with-the-glycemic-index\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">choosing good carbs with the glycemic index<\/a> by Harvard Health Publications if you\u2019re interested in following the GI method.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Get_Started_With_This_3-Day_Sample_Diabetes_Diet_Meal_Plan\">Get Started With This 3-Day Sample Diabetes Diet Meal Plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20173\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Get-Started-With-This-3-Day-Sample-Diabetes-Diet-Meal-Plan.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20173\" class=\"wp-image-20173 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Get-Started-With-This-3-Day-Sample-Diabetes-Diet-Meal-Plan.webp\" alt=\"diabetes diet plan\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20173\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Get Started With This 3-Day Sample Diabetes Diet Meal Plan<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Still wondering where to get started?
