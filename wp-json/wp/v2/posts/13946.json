There are lots of general exercises that work well for PCOS, right from weight training to aerobic exercises. And there are specific exercises for PCOS, such as specific yoga asanas and other exercises that promote hormonal health (remember: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/what-causes-pcos\/\">PCOS is a hormonal disorder<\/a>.) The Aviva Method is one such exercise that\u2019s proven to be effective for many women with PCOS.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Aviva_Method_For_PCOS_How_Does_It_Work\">The Aviva Method For PCOS: How Does It Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The\u00a0Aviva\u00a0Method\u00a0is a completely natural\u00a0method, which consists of several exercises. It was developed by Aviva Steiner from Israel. It includes 18 basic exercises that are known to strengthen and stimulate the inner and outer muscles of the lower abdominal area. All the exercises under the Aviva Method are a result of decades of research. Practising these exercises on a regular basis provides several benefits, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased supply of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to reproductive organs, resulting in improved reproductive health<\/li>\n<li>Hormonal growth, resulting in naturally balanced hormones<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>PCOS is a hormonal disorder that interferes with the reproductive system. This makes the Aviva Method an excellent choice for PCOS.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Other_Health_Benefits_Of_The_Aviva_Method\">Other Health Benefits Of The Aviva Method<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The\u00a0Aviva\u00a0method\u00a0offers a natural, medication-free solution for improving fertility and regularizing periods. In addition to PCOS, the Aviva method works for a range of other female health issues, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Painful or long menstrual periods<\/li>\n<li>Unexplained infertility<\/li>\n<li>Absence of or irregular periods<\/li>\n<li>Uncomfortable menopausal symptoms<\/li>\n<li>Urinary incontinence (the loss of bladder control or leaky bladder)<\/li>\n<li>Hormonal weight problems<\/li>\n<li>Uterine fibroids (tumors in the uterus)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Aviva method offers hope for men too. It includes a separate set of exercises designed specifically for men to address conditions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low sperm count &amp; motility<\/li>\n<li>Male infertility<\/li>\n<li>Prostate health issues<\/li>\n<li>Erectile dysfunction<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Where_Can_You_Learn_The_Exercises_Prescribed_Under_The_Aviva_Method\">Where Can You Learn The Exercises Prescribed Under The Aviva Method?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The\u00a0AVIVA\u00a0method\u00a0can be practiced by adults in general, women and men, regardless of age. However, there are\u00a0a few conditions in which it is not recommended. Also, it takes some amount of practice to master the exercise sequences under the Aviva Method.\u00a0 Therefore, it is recommended to learn these exercises only under the supervision of qualified trainers. You will find qualified Aviva trainers all over the world. You can also learn about the Aviva method online. There are several trainers, like me, who can help you get trained on these exercises. All you need is a webcam and a reliable internet connection.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Final_Thoughts\">Final Thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Just like all holistic methods of treatment for PCOS, the Aviva method works well if it is complemented with changes to diet and lifestyle. But if you follow the exercise regimen regularly, you can conquer PCOS and lead a normal life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 The Aviva Method For PCOS: How Does It Work?2 Other Health Benefits Of The Aviva Method3 Where Can You Learn The Exercises Prescribed Under The Aviva Method?4 Final Thoughts For anyone struggling with PCOS, the first bit of advice is to exercise regularly.
