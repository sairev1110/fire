Do you feel like you simply don\u2019t have the energy to carry out simple everyday chores by dusk? Chances are that your body isn\u2019t getting enough protein. And that is especially true for those of you who are vegan or prefer a Best protein powder.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As one of the three main macro nutrients our body needs for survival, protein plays a crucial role in muscle growth, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/weight-loss-after-forty-how-to-deal-with-insulin-resistance-and-lose-weight\/\">weight loss and wellness. <\/a><\/strong>Healthy proteins play a key role in several aspects of body weight regulation<strong>.<\/strong> \u00a0They help you<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feel more Satiated<\/li>\n<li>Help Build Muscle Mass<\/li>\n<li>Keep Blood Sugars Stable<\/li>\n<li>Repair and Maintain Healthy Skin and Hair<\/li>\n<li>Prevent Muscle wastage and<\/li>\n<li>Assist in Hormone Production.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Proteins are also essential to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/simple-secrets-to-manage-brain-fog\/\">keep your mind sharp and prevent brain fog.<\/a> So you see, <em>proteins are very important!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You could do a few things to tip the dietary scale in your favor on protein intake by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/5-great-reasons-why-should-quinoa-be-integral-to-your-diet\/\">adding things like quinoa to your diet. <\/a>However, it\u2019s not always possible to get your daily recommended dosage of protein through diet alone these days. <em>The DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound.<\/em> That means &#8211; 56 grams\/day for the average sedentary man, and 46 grams\/day for the average sedentary woman. If you lead an active lifestyle, that number goes up correspondingly. <strong>If your diet doesn\u2019t supply the DRI of protein every day because you\u2019re too busy to cook a protein-rich meal every day or are vegan, protein powders may be one of the options for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Protein_Powders_The_Biggest_Mistake_To_Avoid_While_Taking_Them\">Protein Powders: The Biggest Mistake To Avoid While Taking Them<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It is important to note that people who are recommended protein powders by their trainers or gym buddies are also told to go low on fat &#8211; the standard body building mantra. <strong>That is one of the biggest pitfalls to avoid, when considering extra protein intake.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Extra proteins can deplete the crucial Vitamin A from the body, if unaccompanied by a proportionate increase in good fats. Vitamin A is stored in the liver, to be used for a whole range of bodily functions &#8211; including hormone creation, immune actions, good vision and hearing, building strong bones, etc. When you increase your intake of protein, your body needs extra Vitamin A to synthesize those proteins.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have enough in your diet, not only will you not be able to use the extra proteins properly, you will also run out of\u00a0 Vitamin A for other vital functions. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, most abundant in good fats. Butter, ghee, full cream milk, organic grass fed meat are all rich sources of Vitamin A. So if you choose to, for reasons of convenience or religious preference, to get proteins from a protein powder rather from whole foods like meat, make sure you&#8217;re getting plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/healthy-fats-why-everyone-must-eat-them\/\">good fats<\/a> in your diet as well.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Different_Protein_Types_And_What_Is_The_Best_Protein_Supplement_For_You\">Different Protein Types And What Is The Best Protein Supplement For You?<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Whey_Protein\">Whey Protein<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18702\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Protein-Powder-4th-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18702\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18702\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Protein-Powder-4th-image.webp\" alt=\"Best Protien Powder -Whey Protien \" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Best Protien Powder -Whey Protien<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The most common of them all, it contains easily digestible essential amino acids along with an impressive array of minerals and vitamins. <strong>Whey protein reigns supreme when it comes to post-workout shakes<\/strong> as it helps repair muscle mass post workout and also increases muscle size and strength.

However,<strong> soy protein has also been linked to potential disruption of hormone levels when ingested in excess,<\/strong> thanks to the isoflavones in soy. The jury is still out on whether or not soy proteins negatively impact your health in the long run, but most scientists believe that there\u2019s no reason to worry about the potentially-negative isoflavones in soy as long as you limit soy-based foods in addition to your soy protein shakes.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Egg_Proteins\">Egg Proteins<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you are looking for\u00a0an option of what is the best protein powder in\u00a0a slow-release protein powder form, egg proteins come out on tops as something that can be taken anytime of the day.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pea_Proteins\">Pea Proteins<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you have specific dietary considerations and are on the lookout for a plant-based protein powder that can boost your daily intake of amino acids, pea protein powders are the answer. Naturally fat and cholesterol free as well as free from dairy, these are perfect for those who are lactose-intolerant, vegan, or allergic to gluten. <strong>Pea proteins also a good choice for those who notice gastric distress (<em>or any other stomach problem, really<\/em>) when using dairy-based protein powders.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Brown_Rice_Proteins\">Brown Rice Proteins<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18704\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Protein-Powder-5th-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18704\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18704\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Protein-Powder-5th-image.webp\" alt=\"Best Protein Powder - Brown Rice Protien\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18704\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Best Protein Powder &#8211; Brown Rice Protien<\/p><\/div>\n<p>These are 100% plant-based, gluten-free and also dairy-free.

Our body needs proteins on a cellular level to live and to renew. This is especially true if you&#8217;re doing strenuous work in the gym, trying to build muscle, etc. You can use protein powders if you simply cannot get enough from natural sources, but remember the earlier caveat about ensuring you&#8217;re not low on Vitamin A.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Vegan_Protein_Powder_Blends_Worth_The_Hype\">Vegan Protein Powder Blends: Worth The Hype?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you do your research well and choose one of the above mentioned plant-based protein powder blends, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be advertised as \u2018Vegan Protein Powder \u2018for you to get the best amino acid profile. However, some vegan protein powders have added fiber to make them more filling, becoming a better choice for weight loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The best vegan protein blends are those that mix two or more protein sources.<\/strong> Pea proteins are deficient in the amino acid Cysteine, while brown rice protein powders are low in amino acid Lysine.

Here are 10 simple tips on how to pick a protein powder that\u2019s perfect for your specific needs.<\/li>\n<li>If you are looking to gain muscle mass, choose whey proteins as these have a higher biological value than other protein powder types.<\/li>\n<li>If your goal is to lose weight, look for protein powder blends with no added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Also, protein powders with added BCAAs are designed to aid in muscle growth and weight gain, so avoid these as well.<\/li>\n<li>If you are diabetic, make sure your protein powder comes with no added sugar and has no more than 5gm of carbohydrate per serving.<\/li>\n<li>People with gastrointestinal problems are better off with protein powders that don\u2019t contain lactose and gluten.<\/li>\n<li>As a rule of thumb, pick protein shakes that don\u2019t have added fillers. Some manufacturers add coconut flour or psyllium to save money; look out for these undesirable fillers.<\/li>\n<li>Also avoid protein powders that contain added thickeners and gum, as these can add to gastric discomfort.<\/li>\n<li>Some protein powders advertised for weight loss can contain added vegetable oils and fats to make the taste creamier. These are best avoided, as these are trans fats you don\u2019t need.<\/li>\n<li>Also, rule out added dextrins\/maltodextrins. These raise the glycaemic load which can lead to fat storage. They\u2019re added to many budget-friendly protein powders to bulk it up and also make them easier to mix.<\/li>\n<li>If you have dietary constraints but need an economical choice, opt for a pea protein powder. It\u2019s highly digestible, hypo-allergenic and easier on the pocket.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you are a pro athlete or a fitness enthusiast, its best to pick a quick-release protein powder and take it within 60 minutes of your workout. However, if you are looking for a protein powder to supplement weight loss, choose a low-release formula as protein powder meal replacement.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, don&#8217;t forget the caveat about getting sufficient Vitamin A via good fats, whenever you choose to up your protein intake.
