It comes from the desert plant <em>Salvia hispanica, <\/em>a member of the mint family that grows abundantly in Southern Mexico. There are many health benefits of chia seeds, and so are the ways in which you can devour them. You can consume them raw, as soaked in water or juice, and can even add them to your smoothies and salads for that extra crunch! For vegans, they are also an excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/substitute-for-egg\/\">substitute for eggs<\/a>, because of their ability to absorb water and fat, especially while baking.\u00a0Chia seeds come in two colours, black and white. Both of them contain similar amounts of nutrients like omega-3s, protein and fibre, although black chia seeds may contain more antioxidants.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Nutrient_Density_Of_Chia_Seeds\">Nutrient Density Of Chia Seeds<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Chia seeds are small in size but they are <a href=\"http:\/\/nutritiondata.self.com\/facts\/nut-and-seed-products\/3061\/2\">high in nutrition<\/a>.\u00a0A 1-ounce portion will provide you with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>4g of protein<\/li>\n<li>42% of the daily recommended amount of fibre<\/li>\n<li>30% of the\u00a0daily recommended amount of manganese<\/li>\n<li>27% of the\u00a0daily recommended amount of phosphorus<\/li>\n<li>18% of the daily recommended amount of calcium<\/li>\n<li>4,915 mg of omega-3 fatty acids<\/li>\n<li>1,620 mg of omega-6 fatty acids<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Are_The_Health_Benefits_Of_Chia_Seeds\">What Are The Health Benefits Of Chia Seeds?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-14784 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Chia-Seeds-2nd-image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Grown_organically_are_non-GMO\">Grown organically &amp; are non-GMO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Chia seeds are a whole grain food. So one of the biggest benefits of chia seeds is that they are usually grown organically and are non-GMO. With chia seeds, you don\u2019t have to worry about consuming harmful pesticide residues.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Promote_bone_health\">Promote bone health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The benefits of chia seeds are attributed to the calcium content and other trace minerals known for their role in bone health. A 25g portion of chia contains 157mg of calcium, which is more than that in 100ml of milk.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rich_in_antioxidants\">Rich in antioxidants<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Chia seeds are loaded with antioxidants, which prevent the sensitive fats in the seeds from going rancid. The reproduction of free radicals, a natural by-product of the body, yet an enemy of it, can be prevented by these antioxidants. Free radicals can damage molecules in cells and contribute to ageing and diseases like cancer, which can be prevented by consuming chia seeds.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Help_in_losing_weight\">Help in losing weight<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Chia seeds are a rich source of fibre, which absorbs large amounts of water and expands in the stomach. This helps with your satiety levels and keeps hunger cravings at bay. Another benefit of chia seeds is they are a good source of protein, which can help in reducing appetite and hunger.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Regulate_blood_sugar_levels\">Regulate blood sugar levels<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Stable blood sugar levels are essential for optimal health. One of the many benefits of chia seeds is that they are high in fibre, protein and omega-3s. All of these nutrients improve metabolic health, which in turn helps in keeping your blood sugar levels stable.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rich_in_omega-3_fatty_acids\">Rich in omega-3 fatty acids<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are known for their anti-inflammatory effects as well as for enhancing brain and heart health. Also they contain omega-3 in the plant form, making them particulary beneficial for vegetarians\/those who don&#8217;t have fish.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Good_source_of_protein\">Good source of protein<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>They are loaded with proteins, which makes them a useful source of plant protein. They also offer a range of amino acids, making them useful for those who follow a vegetarian and vegan diet. They are also great for weight loss as protein is a very friendly nutrient for this purpose.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Powerful_stress_busters\">Powerful stress busters<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Chia seeds are a rich source of magnesium, which helps in keeping cortisol, the stress hormone, in control. They are also known to be great mood boosters. Chia seeds are high in tryptophan, an amino acid that helps your body produce serotonin, which is known as the \u2018feel-good\u2019 chemical.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Improve_sleep\">Improve sleep<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Serotonin and melatonin are two hormones that are essential for your sleeping pattern. These are produced by tryptophan, an amino acid in the body. Chia seeds, being high in tryptophan, promote good sleep and relaxation. Tryptophan is also used for treating numerous sleep disorders.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Natural_beauty_food\">Natural beauty food<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of chia seeds is that they promote great skin, hair and nails. This is because of the combination of omega-3, antioxidants, protein and minerals, including zinc, in chia seeds. Omega-3 fatty acids also reduce inflammation, dryness and increase circulation. Say hello to glowing skin!<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Help_in_fighting_constipation\">Help in fighting constipation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Being loaded with fibre is one of the many benefits of chia seeds. This power nutrient can whip your digestive system into shape. The fibre found in chia seeds consists of insoluble and soluble fibre. Soluble fibre helps to preserve more water in your stool, which allows it to pass easily through your intestines. Insoluble fibre adds bulk to your stool, which helps in preventing constipation.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Easy_to_incorporate_in_your_diet\">Easy to incorporate in your diet<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Unlike some other seeds, chia seeds don\u2019t need to be grounded and can be eaten raw or even soaked. Adding chia seeds to your daily food will dramatically boost its nutritional value.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Help_in_fighting_breast_cancer\">Help in fighting breast cancer<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Chia seeds are a good source of alpha-linoleic acid, which help prevent breast cancer. Studies show that chia seed oil has anti-cancer properties. It appeared to reduce tumour growth and inhibit the replication of cancer cells.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 What Are Chia Seeds?2 Nutrient Density Of Chia Seeds3 What Are The Health Benefits Of Chia Seeds?3.1 Grown organically &amp; are non-GMO3.2 Promote bone health3.3 Rich in antioxidants3.4 Help in losing weight3.5 Regulate blood sugar levels3.6 Rich in omega-3 fatty acids3.7 Good source of protein3.8 Powerful stress busters3.9 Improve sleep3.10 Natural beauty [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":89,"featured_media":20726,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[69],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -
