Clearly, it\u2019s about elevated blood sugar levels. But hey, it&#8217;s also more than that. The food we eat feeds the bacteria in our gut. Eat too many carbs\/processed foods and you feed the wrong bacteria. Often, diabetics get the disease by doing exactly that. Too much sugar simply translates into the overgrowth of bad bacteria (like yeast). So, it comes as no surprise that <strong>probiotics (good gut bacteria) and diabetes are closely linked.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Direct_Impact_Of_Probiotics_On_Diabetes\"><span id=\"Direct_Impact_Of_Probiotics_On_Diabetes\">Direct Impact Of Probiotics On Diabetes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Probiotics play a huge role in digestion. Many of us are ignorant about the importance and benefits of probiotics. Probiotics, or good gut bacteria, should ideally comprise at least 80% of the total gut bacteria. If you are diabetic, adding probiotics, as either food or supplements, can change things dramatically. <strong>Of course, you also need to eat the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/simple-diabetic-diet\/\">right diet<\/a> to feed the right bacteria after that.<\/strong> Some of the best probiotics for diabetics modify disturbances in their metabolisms positively. There is strong scientific evidence supporting the fact that consuming probiotics helps decrease the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.floraproactiv.co.uk\/article\/detail\/1227115\/what-is-serum-cholesterol\"> serum cholesterol level<\/a> and improves insulin sensitivity.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/stress-meditation-type-2-diabetes\/\">Meditation And Type 2 Diabetes<\/a><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"Probiotics_and_Diabetes_The_Science_Behind_It\"><span id=\"Probiotics_and_Diabetes_The_Science_Behind_It\">Probiotics and Diabetes: The Science Behind It<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>How does probiotics help diabetics? Probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in correct dosages and form, give you a ton of health benefits. Probiotic supplements have been proven to have positive effects on cardio-metabolic parameters in patients with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/symptoms-of-type-2-diabetes\/\">Type 2 Diabetes.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>According to research conducted at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4498615\/\">Loughborough University<\/a>, probiotics prevent insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is often caused by consuming foods that contain trans fats for a long time. The study found that a high trans-fat and processed food diet can reduce insulin sensitivity by as much as 27%, in healthy adults. Supplementation with probiotics helped normalize insulin functioning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven short-term consumption of high-fat, processed foods aids the development of metabolic diseases, diabetes type 2 being one of them. However, probiotics\u2019 impact on insulin resistance is a significant breakthrough. Also, probiotics can reduce fasting blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients,\u201d said Dr. Carl Hulston of Loughborough University.<\/p>\n<p>Type 1 diabetics are people who have lost the ability to produce any insulin naturally. In a ground-breaking<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25626737\"> study<\/a>, researchers engineered a strain of Lactobacillus, a human probiotic. This was done to secrete a chemical called GLP-1 from it (which is naturally produced in the human body.) It was, then, administered orally to diabetic rats.<\/p>\n<p>The compound GLP-1 made the inner skin cells of the rats\u2019 intestines act like pancreatic cells. Pancreatic cells monitor blood glucose levels and balance insulin in the body. After 90 days, it was found that the diabetic rats were able to reduce their blood glucose levels since they were able to produce insulin by themselves. This study gives hope for gauging the advantages of probiotics for Type 1 diabetics as well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/early-signs-of-diabetes-in-women\/\">Early Signs And Symptoms Of Diabetes In Women<\/a><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"Can_Probiotics_Help_Diabetes\"><span id=\"Can_Probiotics_Help_Diabetes\">Can Probiotics Help Diabetes?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Probiotics have significant effects on the reduction of the following in individuals with diabetes<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glucose<\/li>\n<li>HbA1c<\/li>\n<li>Insulin levels<\/li>\n<li>Insulin resistance<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Probiotic bacteria communicate with and trigger immune responses, not just in the GI tract but throughout the body.

It leads, also, to less glucose uptake by muscle cells. More sugar is released from the liver, in this situation. The pancreas is also impacted, leading to reduced insulin secretion. Studies also reveal that when you eat the wrong foods and upset the balance of good bacteria in the gut, you make yourself vulnerable to several other health conditions. The wrong bacteria make your gut leaky which can, in turn, lead to toxins leaking into the blood. With time, this could cause a host of autoimmune diseases like \u2013<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crohn&#8217;s disease<\/li>\n<li>Multiple Sclerosis<\/li>\n<li>Lupus<\/li>\n<li>Rheumatoid Arthritis and many others<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All this only adds to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/amazing-benefits-of-probiotic-supplements\/\">benefits that probiotics have on diabetics <\/a>in ways that go beyond blood sugar control.<br \/>\nHowever, it is also important to realize that several factors, besides diet, affect blood sugar control and insulin function in the human body.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if you&#8217;re not<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/diabetes-and-sleep-apnea\/\"> sleeping right<\/a>, it can affect your blood sugar in the morning.<\/li>\n<li>A simple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/how-does-exercise-help-diabetes\/\">walk, after dinner<\/a>, can make a huge difference on how your body handles blood sugar.<\/li>\n<li>Ensuring that your body gets the right nutrients, like\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/magnesium-and-diabetes-type-2\/\">Magnesium<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/vitamin-d-and-diabetes\/\">Vitamin D<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/chromium-for-diabetes-type-2\/\">Chromium<\/a> and make a huge difference.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Diabetes is a system-wide disorder, one that can respond amazingly well to small changes across a variety of areas.
