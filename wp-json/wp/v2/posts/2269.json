How much sugar does a banana have? Perhaps these are the most frequently asked questions from people who are suffering from diabetes health condition. And the\u00a0answer is Yes, as long as they are unripe or semi-ripe and you don\u2019t overdo it and eat a whole dozen.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of this article explains why.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Diabetics_Need_to_Watch_Their_Carbs\"><span id=\"Diabetics_Need_to_Watch_Their_Carbs\">Diabetics Need to Watch Their Carbs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>All carbohydrates we eat turn into sugar in our body. Insulin is needed to take this sugar into cells. People suffering from Type-2 diabetes usually have two problems; one, their pancreas don\u2019t produce as much insulin as their bodies can use and two, their cells are not very sensitive to insulin. The result: blood sugar can shoot up.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why diabetics need to watch their carbs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bananas are full of good stuff; in addition to carbs (around 30 grams in an average-sized banana), they are loaded with fiber, Vitamins B6 and C, manganese, copper and potassium.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/lower-blood-sugar-levels-naturally\/\" rel=\"noopener\">17 Ways To Lower Your Blood Sugar Without Medications<\/a><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"Bananas_Have_A_Low_GI_Index\"><span id=\"Bananas_Have_a_Low_GI_Index\">Bananas Have a Low GI Index<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18632\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Untitled-design-1.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18632\" class=\"size-large wp-image-18632\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Untitled-design-1-1024x469.webp\" alt=\"how many bananas can a diabetic eat a day\" width=\"1024\" height=\"469\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18632\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">how many bananas can a diabetic eat a day<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Overall, bananas have a low glycemic index (GI), the score that measures how much a food increases your blood sugar level when you eat it. The lower the GI, the better. Where a 30-gram serving of brown bread has a glycemic index of 69, a 120-gram serving of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/diseases-and-conditions\/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">raw banana has a glycemic index of just 48<\/a>. You can also create your own healthy dessert by sprinkling powdered cinnamon on sliced or diced bananas.

This is because the starch in the banana has been converted into sugar by nature, as the banana ripens.<\/p>\n<div class=\"col-md-12 arti-subsc\">\n<div class=\"subscriberow\">[mc4wp_form id=&#8221;12950&#8243;]<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>The same banana, when in an unripe or semi-ripe state, could actually make a great snack for diabetics, giving them all the goodness it contains, without the sugar rush<\/strong>. Research has shown that digestion-resistant starch in green bananas can actually help stabilize blood sugar levels as well as insulin response.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, the good starch can also feed good bacteria in the gut, helping improve metabolic health in diabetics. The vitamin B6 in the bananas reduces stress and helps regulate metabolism. Both factors greatly help in managing diabetes. The potassium in bananas helps in maintaining cardiovascular health.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/8-top-research-backed-diabetes-superfoods\/\">8 Top Research-Backed Diabetes Superfoods<\/a><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"Size_Matters\"><span id=\"Size_Matters\">Size Matters<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Since diabetics are often asked to manage their total intake of carbohydrates in a day, the size of the banana does matter. Assuming you want to use it as a snack, remember that a medium size unripe banana would contain around 27 grams of carbohydrates, so factor that into your overall diet plan.<\/p>\n<p>So, <strong>is banana good for diabetic people<\/strong>? For sure, it is! Just make sure it\u2019s unripe or semi-ripe and not too large.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Diabetics Need to Watch Their Carbs2 Bananas Have a Low GI Index3 Ripe vs Unripe: The Crucial Difference for Diabetics4 Size Matters Can Diabetics Eat Bananas?
