Yes, there are those who do yoga for diabetes and do a lot of advanced sequences and poses, but the yoga that can help you with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/10-tips-preventing-diabetes-type-2\/\">type-2 diabetes<\/a> is usually simple enough for anyone to learn and do. Having a qualified teacher always helps, especially if you\u2019re just beginning your journey into this ancient science of holistic well-being.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Do_Yoga_Poses_Really_Work_for_Type-2_Diabetes\"><span id=\"Do_Yoga_Poses_Really_Work_for_Type-2_Diabetes\">Do Yoga Poses Really Work for Type-2 Diabetes?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You bet your ochre pajamas it does. There are tens of papers published on research studies conducted to study the efficacy of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/top-5-yoga-asanas-for-diabetes\/\">Yoga <\/a>for improving disease parameters of Type-2 Diabetes. In most of these, participants felt the changes themselves \u2013from improved energy levels to lowered sugar cravings to improvements in diabetic neuropathy and improved sleep (a huge factor for improving diabetes parameters). But science demands evidence, especially when the practice sounds oriental and \u201cnew-world-y\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>So here it is. One very effective way of examining the evidence is to look for a \u201csystematic review\u201d of several studies. The underlying studies should examine if Yoga works for Type-2 diabetes, in terms of objective outcomes \u2013 like lab-measured fasting blood glucose or triglycerides and body fat composition.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s exactly what authors Kim E Innes, Ph.D. and Terry Kit Selfe, D.C. and Ph.D. did. They carefully examined 25 such research studies, that included 2170 participants who did yoga over periods varying from 15 days to 12 months, with the vast majority of these lasting at least 12-weeks.<\/p>\n<p>They then published their findings in the Journal for Diabetic Research in the 2016 paper, \u201cYoga for Adults with Type 2 Diabetes: Systematic Review of Controlled Trials\u201d. They found that <strong>\u201cyogic practices may promote significant improvements in several indices of importance in DM2 management, including glycemic control, lipid levels, and body composition&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s impressive.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Does_The_Yoga_for_Controlling_Diabetes_Have_Other_Benefits_As_Well\"><span id=\"Does_Yoga_Have_Other_Benefits_As_Well\">Does Yoga Have Other Benefits As Well?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Yes, it does. Yoga works on not just the gross physical body (meaning muscles, organs, etc.) but goes beyond, to work on more subtle levels, such as the nervous system and the mind. Today, researchers are saying that people with diabetes are \u201cinflamed,\u201d\u00a0a state that is accompanied by a continuous feeling of stress and the damage it causes.Yoga has a positive impact on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The parasympathetic nervous system<\/li>\n<li>It helps the body deal with the inflammation better and<\/li>\n<li>Reduces stress hormones and the destruction they cause.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Innes and Selfe reported that in the 25 studies they examined, they found evidence that \u201cMore limited data suggest that yoga may also lower oxidative stress and blood pressure; enhance pulmonary and autonomic function, mood, sleep, and quality of life; and reduce medication use in adults with DM2.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Is_Yoga_Dangerous\"><span id=\"Is_Yoga_Dangerous\">Is Yoga Dangerous?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Yes, but then so is crossing the road. If you do it right \u2013 and that means, gradually building up strength and flexibility, never over-reaching, listening to and following the special instructions given by the Yoga teacher \u2013 then, it can become the most rewarding routine of your daily life.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Do_I_Need_to_Set_Aside_Hours_Each_Day_to_Receive_The_Benefits_of_Yoga\"><span id=\"Do_I_Need_to_Set_Aside_Hours_Each_Day_to_Receive_The_Benefits_of_Yoga\">Do I Need to Set Aside Hours Each Day to Receive The Benefits of Yoga?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18748\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/owomenyogaclassfacebook.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18748\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18748\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/owomenyogaclassfacebook.webp\" alt=\"Yoga has a positive impact on the nervous system, helps the body deal with the inflammation better and reduces stress hormones.\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18748\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yoga has a positive impact on the nervous system, helps the body deal with the inflammation better and reduces stress hormones.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>You can start with as little as 10 minutes a day, gradually building up to say, half an hour each day.
