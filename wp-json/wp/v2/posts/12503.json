Some oils, like peppermint, lavender, turmeric and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/functional-dyspepsia-treating-with-ginger-and-artichoke\/\">ginger <\/a>essential oils can aid in digestion and at the same time calm the spasms associated with reflux. Lemon and Ginger essential oils block acid production and suppress <em>H.Pylori<\/em> bacteria activity, soothing digestive issues, bloating and stomach aches.<\/p>\n<p>However, it\u2019s important to be aware that peppermint essential oil is a rather potent treatment, and when used incorrectly, it can result in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/gerd-ulcers\/\">increased GERD symptoms<\/a> because it may relax the LES (lower esophageal sphincter) \u2013 a muscular lid between the esophagus and stomach, letting stomach acid travel back up the esophagus and into the mouth. If peppermint essential oil doesn\u2019t work for you, try turmeric and ginger essential oils instead. These are safe for ingestion and also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/essential-oils-for-stomach-ulcers\/\">heal gastric ulcers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that not all essential oils are created equal. To find heartburn relief, it\u2019s imperative that you choose the highest quality essential oils that are made from pesticide-free plants. Also, make sure you use 100% pure, high-quality essential oils that do not contain any synthetic additives. It\u2019s best to do a bit of research or ask for professional advice to help find a good, reputable brand.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"A_Word_of_Warning\">A Word of Warning<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While essential oils are easy to buy from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/side-effects-of-antacids\/\">local drug<\/a> stores and health food stores, we highly recommend that you work with an expert to find the correct dosage and usage method for your specific ailments. Essential oils can be more potent than many of us believe them to be! When it comes to essential oils, more is not better. We highly recommend you work with a naturopath if you plan ingestion of any essential oil for acid reflux.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Extracted from plants using a unique distillation process, some essential oils promote faster healing for your gut and come without unwanted side effects.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24,"featured_media":19840,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[14,25],"tags":[44,22,45],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>4 Essential Oils For Heartburn &amp; How To Use Them | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The use of essential oils for heartburn has been prevalent for centuries.
