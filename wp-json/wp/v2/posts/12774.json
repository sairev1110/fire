Heart disease is the leading cause of death in men and women in the United States accounting for 610,000 deaths every year. Coronary heart disease kills more than 370,000 people in the US every year. While inserting a stent or a surgical intervention like CABG remains the only hope for patients of advanced arterial blockage, a fairly new non-invasive technique called <strong>EECP therapy<\/strong> is being touted as a \u201cmiracle\u201d for millions of sufferers of heart diseases. Is EECP really that effective? Let\u2019s find out more.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_EECP_How_Long_Does_Treatment_Last\">What is EECP &amp; How Long Does Treatment Last?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>EECP, or Enhanced External Counterpulsation, is a non-invasive, outpatient procedure for the treatment for angina. It involves binding cuffs to a patient\u2019s legs and buttocks and inflating-deflating them sequentially to complement the heart\u2019s natural beating rhythm. A continuous electrocardiogram programs the inflation and deflation cycle. A finger monitor measures the amount of oxygen in the patient\u2019s blood and also measures the pressure waves created by these inflations and deflations.<\/p>\n<p>The treatment duration of EECP therapy is usually 35 hours, divided as one hour every day, five days a week for 7 weeks. During the treatment, the patient lies comfortably on a specially-designed bed. Cuffs similar to those used to measure blood pressure are wrapped around the patient\u2019s calves, thighs and buttocks. These cuffs then inflate and deflate at specific time intervals between heart beats. This inflation and deflation is controlled precisely by a computer-controlled ECG machine.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Causes_Angina\">What Causes Angina?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Angina is the body\u2019s signal that the heart muscles are not getting enough blood and thus oxygen. This insufficient blood supply is due to blockage and subsequent narrowing of the arteries. When the heart muscles do not get sufficient blood, they cry out for help. This leads to chest pain or pain down the left arm, between the shoulder blades or in the jaw. If the heart does not receive enough blood for a long period, its muscles become weak and are unable to pump blood for the body. Eventually, this can lead to heart failure.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Does_EECP_Help\">How Does EECP Help?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>EECP therapy works in two ways. One, it increases blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscles, and two, it decreases the heart\u2019s workload of pumping blood. EECP is also shown to increase the production of angiogenesis factors (substances that help formation of new blood vessels from older ones). A study found that EECP acts to increase the production of nitric oxide (NO), which is a vasodilator (dilates the blood vessel) and decreases the production of vasoconstrictor endothelin (ET-1).<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Which_Patients_Benefit_The_Most_from_EECP\">Which Patients Benefit The Most from EECP?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Patients with chronic stable angina (those having symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and cough) can benefit from this treatment procedure. Studies have also indicated that people with severe atherosclerosis (widespread arterial blockage) and persistent angina, silent ischemia (heart problems where there is no pain), heart failure as well as those with kidney and lung failure can also benefit from this treatment.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Does_Research_Say_About_EECP\">What Does Research Say About EECP?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19879\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/lsfefee.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19879\" class=\"wp-image-19879 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/lsfefee.webp\" alt=\"EECP Therapy\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19879\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">What Does Research Say About EECP?<\/p><\/div>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marina_Leitman\/publication\/6673335_The_benefits_and_safety_of_external_counterpulsation_in_symptomatic_heart_failure\/links\/00463533cf7c6b9591000000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">joint study <\/a>by Israeli and American scientists assessed the benefits and safety of EECP in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/congestive-heart-failure\/\">heart failure<\/a> patients.

After one year, both groups had near-similar health characteristics. This proves that EECP is a safe treatment option for selected patients with obstructive coronary disease.<\/p>\n<p>A recent review examines all the studies done so far on the efficacy of EECP in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). It found that EECP therapy significantly increases blood flow through heart muscles and improves angina pectoris in CAD patients after EECP therapy.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Type_Of_Patients_Arent_Fit_For_EECP_Therapy\">What Type Of Patients Aren\u2019t Fit For EECP Therapy?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Patients with the following conditions aren\u2019t fit for EECP therapy:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) that interfere with machine triggering<\/li>\n<li>Bleeding disorders (due to problems with the blood coagulation system)<\/li>\n<li>Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of vein due to blood clot)<\/li>\n<li>Vaso-occlusive disease (a severe, often painful, complication of sickle cell anemia)<\/li>\n<li>Aortic aneurysm (where aorta is enlarged or dilated to 1.5 times its original diameter)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Also, the therapy is not suited for pregnant women.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Precautions_to_be_Followed_Prior_to_EECP_Therapy\">Precautions to be Followed Prior to EECP Therapy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>Blood pressure higher than 180\/110 mmHg should first be controlled before starting EECP therapy. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/heart-rate-variability\/\">Heart rate <\/a>greater than 120 bpm should be controlled first.
