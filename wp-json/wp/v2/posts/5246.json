In people with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/basics\/\">type 2 diabetes<\/a>, the body does not use insulin effectively. The pancreas compensates by overproducing insulin, and in time, it simply cannot keep up with the demands of the body to keep glucose levels down. To provide enough insulin to the body to manage blood glucose levels, many diabetics are advised to take insulin shots.<\/p>\n<p>The insulin in these injections is a chemical that is produced artificially to resemble the insulin made in our pancreas. This insulin works just like natural insulin by escorting sugar from our blood into our cells. Type 2 diabetics deal with a condition known as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Insulin_resistance\">insulin resistance<\/a>. It is a phenomenon where cells aren\u2019t sensitive to the action of insulin (escorting blood glucose into cells) and hence, do not respond to it. This leads to the accumulation of glucose in the blood and is called hyperglycemia. Supplemental insulin given to Type 2 diabetics helps the body \u2018muscle\u2019 sugar out of the bloodstream and into cells.<\/p>\n<p>Insulin injections are used to <a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/druginfo\/meds\/a682611.html\">regulate blood sugar<\/a> differently for the different diabetes-types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For people who have type 1 diabetes &#8211; Their bodies cannot make insulin and therefore they aren\u2019t able to regulate the amount of glucose in their bloodstream.<\/li>\n<li>For people who have type 2 diabetes &#8211; Their bodies aren\u2019t able to produce enough insulin, or use it effectively.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The insulin shots are used because the blood sugar cannot be regulated with oral medications alone.<\/p>\n<div class=\"col-md-12 arti-subsc\">\n<div class=\"subscriberow\">[mc4wp_form id=&#8221;12950&#8243;]<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>They also stop the liver from producing more sugar.

If the diabetic person eats less, it may result in their blood sugar going far lower than it should (hypoglycemia). On the other hand, if too little insulin is delivered, there will be too much blood sugar (hyperglycemia). The person may suffer from insulin overdose side effects. Either way, both conditions can be life-threatening.<\/p>\n<p>If you experience any confusion, excessive sweating, hunger, palpitations and\/or dizziness accompanied by blurred vision, you may be suffering from hypoglycemia caused due to insulin injection side effects.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Weight_Gain\">Weight Gain<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18722\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Weight-check.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18722\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18722\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Weight-check.webp\" alt=\"Weight gain is a common side effect of insulin\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18722\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Weight gain is a common side effect of insulin<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Among insulin side effects, weight gain is something most diabetics are quite wary of.
