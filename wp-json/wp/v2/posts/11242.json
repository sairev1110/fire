The fact that it affects around half the American population attests to the fact that it is a result of bad dietary and lifestyle choices.<\/p>\n<p>Americans spend billions of dollars on acid blocking medications every year. Proton-pump inhibitors, or PPIs, are prescribed to millions of individuals every year. But we know, PPIs actually do more harm than good. They provide symptomatic relief alright, but they gradually make the condition worse. More and more people are looking at complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for alternatives to proton pump inhibitors for GERD. Let\u2019s learn more about natural remedies for GERD.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Try_Natural_Alternatives_To_PPIs_for_Instant_Relief\">Try Natural Alternatives To PPIs for Instant Relief<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The most prominent symptom of acid reflux, or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), is heartburn. This is a result of acidic contents of the stomach sloshing back into the esophagus and irritating its sensitive lining. The first thing on your mind would be to stop this burning sensation. The most common thing to do would be to take an \u201canti-acid\u201d to neutralize the acid that is causing all the trouble and pain. But we know that<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/why-stomach-acid-is-good\/\"> stomach acid ain\u2019t bad<\/a>. And yet, you cannot think of any long-term treatment strategies if you cannot get rid of the heartburn right then.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Natural_treatment_for_Heartburn_Relief\">Natural treatment for Heartburn Relief<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Aloe_juice\"><strong>Aloe juice<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Aloe is known for its activity of soothing burns and is often used on skin to calm sunburns and rashes. The same action can also help soothe the burning sensation inside your esophagus. Aloe has potent anti-inflammatory activity and when your esophagus is inflamed and irritated, a glass of aloe juice can calm down the irritation and burning. Drink half a glass of aloe juice (cool or at room temperature) 5-10 minutes before meals to avoid heartburn.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Chewing_gum\"><strong>Chewing gum<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There is research to prove that people with chronic heartburn experience relief from symptoms when they chew a piece of sugar-free gum for around half an hour. Chewing gum stimulates secretion of a large amount of saliva that dilutes the gut acid thereby giving relief from heartburn. (Did you know that Japanese truck drivers chew gum when they are driving at night to avoid falling asleep while at the wheel? It might also help with their acid reflux!)<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Banana_or_apple\"><strong>Banana or apple<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Bananas and apples have natural antacid activity. Eat a well-ripened banana every day to relieve heartburn. Alternatively, you can eat an apple every day prior to bedtime to prevent discomfort at night (when heartburn is usually at its worst).<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mustard\"><strong>Mustard<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While it tastes great in sandwiches and burgers, a spoonful of mustard when eaten straight from the bottle is a great natural remedy for acid reflux. Mustard has alkaline properties and it also contains a weak acid (acetic acid from the vinegar). Mustard helps neutralize the acid and provides instant relief from heartburn.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Almonds\"><strong>Almonds<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Eating 3-4 almonds after every meal can help prevent bouts of acid reflux. You can also drink a tablespoon of almond milk after every meal to prevent heartburn.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Chamomile_tea\"><strong>Chamomile tea<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Drinking chamomile tea half an hour before going to bed helps reduce the inflammation in the stomach and eases acid reflux symptoms. Chamomile is also a great stress buster and works wonderfully in stress-related acid reflux.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Baking_soda\"><strong>Baking soda<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Baking soda is technically sodium bicarbonate, an alkaline substance. It neutralizes stomach acid and provides instant relief from your heartburn. \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in a glass of water can help in relieving heartburn. A word of caution, though: Do not use this remedy for more than a week at a stretch. It may trigger side effects like swelling and nausea.<\/p>\n<p>There are other great home remedies including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/functional-dyspepsia-treating-with-ginger-and-artichoke\/\">ginger<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/apple-cider-vinegar-acid-reflux\/\">apple cider vinegar<\/a>, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/acid-reflux-remedies-to-support-healing\/\"> raft-forming alginates<\/a> in relieving symptoms of GERD.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Lifestyle_Modifications_To_Help_Reverse_GERD\">Lifestyle Modifications To Help Reverse GERD<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Reversing acid reflux is possible. It will require treating the problem at its root. An imbalance in our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/acid-reflux-medicines-side-effects\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gut microbiome<\/a> is the source of this problem. An overgrowth of the wrong bacterial populations (especially <em>H. pylori<\/em>) causes fermentation, rather than efficient digestion, of food. This causes excessive gas production that increases pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter forcing it to open the wrong way and spilling acidic contents of the stomach into the esophagus. Lifestyle modifications will include correcting the imbalance of the gut microflora, eating the correct diet and decreasing pressure on, and strengthening, the LES.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Watch_your_diet\"><strong>Watch your diet<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A diet full of processed carbs and refined sugars is a sure way to imbalance the gut microflora. A high carbohydrate diet promotes the overgrowth of H. pylori, the root cause of acid reflux. Include fresh greens and \u201creal foods\u201d in your diet to support a healthy bacterial population that will not only keep acid reflux at bay but will play a vital role in the overall health and well-being of your body.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Restore_beneficial_bacteria\"><strong>Restore beneficial bacteria<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Our gut is an awe-inspiring example of biological synergism. It is home to trillions of bacteria, the majority of which help us in one way or the other. When there is overgrowth of bad bacteria, it can cause a wide variety of health problems, including GERD. A<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/probiotics-acid-reflux-benefits-sources\/\"> high-quality probiotic supplement<\/a> will help correct the microfloral imbalance. It will also help beneficial bacteria outgrow <em>H. pylori<\/em> by a phenomenon called competitive inhibition.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Balance_your_acid\"><strong>Balance your acid<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>As we\u2019ve already seen, acid reflux is often the result of less acid. Concentrated hydrochloric acid actually signals the lower esophageal sphincter to shut tight. This is because concentrated HCl will be secreted only when there is food in the stomach and so the sphincter has to close properly to avoid acidic contents to reflux back into the esophagus. Now, when there is less acid or weak acid, the LES does not get proper signaling telling it to shut tight. This can also lead to acid reflux. An HCl supplement that also contains a digestive enzyme like pepsin can help treat GERD. Bitters can also stimulate acid production and can be used to relieve GERD.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Quit_smoking_and_alcohol\"><strong>Quit smoking and alcohol<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Tobacco and alcohol weaken your lower esophageal sphincter, making it easy for it to open the wrong way. Quitting smoking and drinking will not only help your GERD, it will also reduce your risks of other chronic diseases.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Lose_weight\"><strong>Lose weight<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Being overweight, especially around the waist, puts extra pressure on the LES. This makes your GERD worse. Losing weight has many positive outcomes and reduces various health risks.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dont_wear_tight-fitting_clothes\"><strong>Don\u2019t wear tight-fitting clothes<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Wearing tight-fitting clothes, especially around the waist, can put pressure on the stomach. This subsequently puts pressure on the LES and makes your GERD bad.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Elevate_your_head_while_sleeping\"><strong>Elevate your head while sleeping<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Elevating your head while sleeping will ensure that your stomach contents remain downwards and do not flow back through the LES. You can place wooden or cement blocks below the bed on the side where you rest your head to raise the bed and achieve this elevation.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Follow_healthy_eating_habits\"><strong>Follow healthy eating habits<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Practicing healthy eating habits like eating peacefully, chewing well and slowly, eating 5-7 small meals throughout the day to avoid overfilling your stomach at once, drinking water between meals rather than during meals, etc. will help the stomach to produce acid gradually to digest the food properly. This will not cause over-production of acid.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Alternative_Therapies_for_GERD\">Alternative Therapies for GERD<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Acupuncture\">Acupuncture<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19606\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/PPIs-Acupuncture.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19606\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19606\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/PPIs-Acupuncture.webp\" alt=\"Acupuncture\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19606\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Acupuncture<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Acupuncture, the Chinese art and science of pricking small needles at various sites on the body has been around for more than 4000 years.
