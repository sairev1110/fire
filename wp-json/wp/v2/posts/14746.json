Most of us make the mistake of reaching out for that bag of chips, or jelly beans or KitKat (Because we are having a break, duh) or other kinds of junk food because they are convenient or it makes us feel so good. Sadly these foods can actually get counterproductive not just to survive the work day, but can also result in long-term health consequences (Hello, diabetes, obesity and other deadly diseases!) Here we present some healthy snack ideas for work\u00a0that are not only delicious but also provide a host of health benefits.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Foxnuts_Tal_Makhana\">Foxnuts <em>(Tal Makhana)<\/em><\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20731\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Foxnuts-Tal-Makhana.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20731\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20731\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Foxnuts-Tal-Makhana.webp\" alt=\"healthy snack ideas for work\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Foxnuts (Tal Makhana)<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Also known as desi popcorn, these round white beauties are the perfect in-between meal snack. You can pop them as \u201cWork Popcorn\u201d \u2013 to make the screen in front of you even more exciting and to keep you alert and enthused. Moreover, they\u2019re low in cholesterol and sodium. Rich in protein and magnesium, this snack is low in calories, making them an excellent option for those suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. As an added benefit, they also keep you stress-free while prepping for that all-important presentation!\u00a0You can eat these raw, cooked or roasted or sprinkled with half a pinch of salt or pepper. A bowlful of these should keep you going for at least a few hours.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dark_Chocolate\">Dark Chocolate<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20733\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Dark-Chocolate.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20733\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20733\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Dark-Chocolate.webp\" alt=\"healthy snack ideas for work\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20733\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dark Chocolate<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This may sound a little unusual in the list of healthy snack ideas for work. But bitter chocolate (chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content) is not only a natural stress buster, but also improves short-term working memory and concentration. It spikes up your energy to get through that not-so-fun but absolutely necessary spreadsheet! A great mood-booster, a piece of this luscious brown can help you beat the Monday morning blues in no time.\u00a0Indulging in this bittersweet treat also has great long-term benefits. It helps with weight loss and is packed with antioxidants that can\u00a0make you look younger and keep chronic diseases at bay.\u00a030-60 grams a day of dark chocolate, be it as a luscious lunch dessert or as an evening accompaniment to your coffee, can do wonders for your health.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Peanuts_Mungfali\">Peanuts <em>(Mungfali)<\/em><\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20734\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Peanuts-Mungfali.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20734\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20734\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Peanuts-Mungfali.webp\" alt=\"healthy snack ideas for work\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20734\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peanuts (Mungfali)<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Skipped your breakfast in a mad dash to get to work? No worries, peanuts are a perfect item in the list of healthy snack ideas for work. Rich in protein, energy, good cholesterol, and antioxidants, just about 30-40 roasted peanuts will keep you full and satiated right until a late afternoon lunch. Moreover, peanuts also reduce the risk of a heart attack.<\/p>\n<p>Peanuts are one of the rare plant sources of vitamin B complex. Also, they account for 85% of RDI of\u00a0niacin, a nutrient that is responsible for blood flow to the brain &#8212; yet that\u2019s right- where you need it most when working. Besides, it\u2019s perfect for vegetarians who have a tough time getting their required dose of vitamin B.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Almonds_Badaam\">Almonds <em>(Badaam)<\/em><\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20735\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Almonds-Badaam.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20735\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20735\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Almonds-Badaam.webp\" alt=\"healthy snack ideas for work\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20735\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Almonds (Badaam)<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Packed with Vitamin E, proteins, fiber, healthy cholesterol, magnesium, manganese, copper and zinc, almonds are the perfect healthy snacks for work. Almonds are also a powerful source of dietary fiber, potassium, iron, calcium, antioxidants, flavonoids and phytosterols. Moreover, their long shelf life means they can be at your desk for long. If you&#8217;re having roasted almonds, do have these in moderation, as they increase your sodium intake considerably vis-a-vis raw almonds. Eating 28 grams (23 almonds) of this nutrient reduces the risk of heart diseases.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dates_Khajoor\">Dates <em>(Khajoor)<\/em><\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20736\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Dates-Khajoor.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20736\" class=\"wp-image-20736 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Dates-Khajoor.webp\" alt=\"healthy snack ideas for work\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20736\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dates (Khajoor)<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Dry dates aren\u2019t just sweet and delicious but are also packed with vitamins, minerals, iron, and calcium.
