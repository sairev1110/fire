But it doesn\u2019t have to be with a targeted approach! If you focus on beating insulin resistance, balancing your hormones and eating right, your weight will automatically drop down.

An LCHF or Low Carb \u2013 High Fat diet works well for most women with PCOS. Cutting back on carbohydrates reduces insulin load on the body. The reason we recommend LCHF instead of a Low Carb-High Protein diet is because both proteins and carbohydrates have an adverse effect on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4069066\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leptin resistance<\/a> or insulin resistance.

Amp up your fat intake by eating &#8211; ghee, grass-fed butter, olive oil, fatty fish, coconut oil, sesame seed oil, nuts, seeds and avocados. Partially-hydrogenated and hydrogenated fats are best avoided completely. Consuming too many omega-6 fatty acids encourages inflammation.

However, this takes time and patience. And no; starting Metformin and hoping it cures all your woes is not the right approach. Begin by cutting out all refined carbs and sugars from your diet.

And you\u2019d be right. To an extent, that is. Don\u2019t wrongly assume that exercising all day will help you lose a lot of weight faster. It\u2019ll make your body hold on to weight, increase cortisol levels and aid insulin resistance. Regular high intensity workouts with calorie restriction will also reduce your metabolism. Over-exercising and under-eating puts your body under stress and is detrimental to your weight loss goals.

If you have been exercising and still holding on to weight, try cutting back. Good old low-intensity cardio DOES work; don\u2019t disregard it for the more popular HIIT. HIIT is best only in moderation. Make sure to include weight training exercises into your routine; twice a week is a good start.

It\u2019s worsened by yo-yo dieting, which is why we strictly advise you against very low-calorie diets designed for quick weight loss. Leptin dysregulation could be the reason you haven\u2019t lost any weight despite eating 100% clean and exercising every day. Treating leptin resistance is a bit tricky, and begins with eating sufficient calories to rev up your metabolism. Also, don\u2019t over-exercise or eat too much protein. Discuss other ways to manage leptin resistance with your doctor and dietician.<br \/>\n<!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_20249\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Tap-Into-The-Power-Of-Dietary-Supplements.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20249\" class=\"wp-image-20249 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Tap-Into-The-Power-Of-Dietary-Supplements.webp\" alt=\"PCOS weight loss\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20249\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tap Into The Power Of Dietary Supplements<\/p><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Tap_Into_The_Power_Of_Dietary_Supplements\">Tap Into The Power Of Dietary Supplements<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Some supplements can help correct insulin resistance, which will make it easier for you to lose weight.
