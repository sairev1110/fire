Menopause is medically defined as the absence of menstrual period for 12 months. Caused by the decline in female reproductive hormones \u2013 estrogen and progesterone \u2013 menopause marks the permanent end of menstruation and fertility. <br><br>Some women can start transitioning into menopause as early as their late 30s (<em>a period known as perimenopause<\/em>, <em>wherein their periods become less frequent<\/em>), but most women enter menopause some time in their 40s to 50s.  <br><br>During menopause, the ovaries stop producing estrogen, leading to a steady decline in estrogen in blood levels. While the adrenal glands and fat tissue still continue to produce \u2018some\u2019 levels of estrogen throughout life, this marked decline in estrogen levels post menopause is what contributes to a plethora of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/menopause\/menopause-symptoms-supplements\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">menopause symptoms<\/a> \u2013 like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood swings, weight gain and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Some_Common_Symptoms_of_Menopause\"><strong>Some Common Symptoms of Menopause<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Some-Common-Symptoms-of-Menopause.webp\" alt=\"Treat Your Menopause Symptoms\" class=\"wp-image-21110\"\/><figcaption>Some Common Symptoms of Menopause<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As hormone levels and their fluctuations vary from one woman to the other, every woman experiences menopause differently. For some, it\u2019s nothing more than a mere annoyance, while others can face debilitating symptoms that affect their quality of life.<br><br>Some common menopause symptoms include:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Irregular periods \u2013 this is commonly seen in perimenopause when the body is transitioning into menopause. Perimenopause can last for up to 4 years.

While it can come with some annoying symptoms, there\u2019s no reason why a woman cannot live her best life despite the conclusion of her fertile years. With the right approach, you can lead a healthy, vital and sexually active life in your 50s and well beyond, enjoying post-menopausal life. <br><br>Menopause is not an illness, hence doesn\u2019t require medical treatment, in most general cases. Unless a young woman has undergone medical procedures (like hysterectomy, oophorectomy or chemotherapy) that interfere with hormone levels, there rarely is any need for medical intervention. It\u2019s important to realize that common symptoms of menopause \u2013 like hot flashes, mood swings and vaginal dryness \u2013 all resolve themselves in time. <br><br>This is why conventional treatments like Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is unnecessary, and only worsens things in the long run. Many women who try HRT find their menopause symptoms return when they stop using synthetic hormones. On the other hand, there is <a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/ije\/article\/30\/3\/423\/736896\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">emerging evidence<\/a> of several long-term risk factors associated with HRT like breast\/uterine\/endometrial cancer, memory loss and dementia, urinary incontinence, blot clots, incidences of heart attack and stroke, osteoporosis, and venous thromboembolic disease, to name just a few.<br><br>These conventional treatments are limited because they are artificially putting hormones back into the body, when nature has designed for our hormone levels to decline as we age. These hormones don\u2019t need replacing! Instead, natural remedies and therapies for hormone free menopause focus on making the transition to menopause easier, as you learn to live a healthy life despite declined levels of hormones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"8_Natural_Remedies_For_Menopause_Relief\"><strong>8 Natural Remedies For Menopause Relief<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Ashwagandha\"><strong>Ashwagandha<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that helps the body better adapt to changes, without having to resort to allopathic medication.

It relieves menopause symptoms by balancing fluctuating estrogen levels, which is the primary cause behind hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood swings and sleep disturbances. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK79338\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Studies<\/a> testing the efficacy of black cohosh (and other preparations combining it with other herbs) on menopausal symptoms found it to be greatly beneficial, with some claiming that symptoms improved by 41%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Evening_Primrose_Oil\"><strong>Evening Primrose Oil<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"176\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Evening-Primrose-Oil.webp\" alt=\"Treat Your Menopause Symptoms\" class=\"wp-image-21118\"\/><figcaption>Evening Primrose Oil<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and linolenic acid, evening primrose oil can help reduce inflammation and improve bone health.

It helps boost circulation and has estrogen-like effect on the body. More studies are needed to understand how dong quai helps treat menopause symptoms. A small study concluded that a herbal remedy containing dong quai with other herbs (chasteberry, red clover, black cohosh and American ginseng) can help relieve hot flashes as well as reduce sleep disturbances.

A clean diet is also low in empty calories, which helps maintain healthy weight as you age too. <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/BF00053262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Research<\/a> has shown that plant-based diet, especially one low in saturated and trans-fats, can be helpful in easing symptoms of menopause. Aim to cut back on processed and junk food, sugar-rich foods, refined oils, alcohol and processed meats, while you increase intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, probiotics, and Omega 3 fats.
