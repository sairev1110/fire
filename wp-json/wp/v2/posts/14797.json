Let&#8217;s find out why cinnamon for PCOS is a very good home remedy.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does Cinnamon Help With PCOS?<\/h2>\n<p>Cinnamon has been seen to reduce insulin resistance significantly. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/diet-for-insulin-resistance\/\">Insulin resistance<\/a> is considered as the number one cause for both diabetes and PCOS. Cinnamon also reduces the occurrence of Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH,) which also contributes to the occurrence of PCOS. A small <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medicaldaily.com\/cinnamon-could-help-regulate-menstrual-cycles-ease-common-cause-infertility-what-pcos-260170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<\/a> found out that Cinnamon also helps in regulating the frequency of menstrual cycles among women with PCOS.<\/p>\n<h2>Tips To Include Cinnamon In Your Diet<\/h2>\n<p>Cinnamon is a spice that is used by various cuisines of the world.&nbsp;Both western and oriental cuisine make generous use of this wonder spice. Cinnamon&nbsp;comes in mainly two varieties: Ceylon and the Chinese cinnamon. The Ceylon variety as this has a sweeter taste and stronger aroma.&nbsp; For PCOS, it is recommended to use Ceylon cinnamon.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few tips to spice up your food with cinnamon:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cinnamon tea:<\/strong> Start your morning with a cup of cinnamon tea. You could choose the kind of tea as per your taste. Cinnamon can be added to both milk tea and black tea. Try to have it without sugar as it could reduce the effectiveness of cinnamon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cinnamon powder:<\/strong> Sprinkle some cinnamon powder on your yoghurt, smoothies and shakes. Cinnamon is a versatile spice that adds flavour to everything from curries to desserts. You can sprinkle some cinnamon powder in your smoothies and shakes and have a cool and refreshing drink after a workout session.<\/p>\n<p>Seasoning your fruit salad with cinnamon is also a good way to include this spice in your daily diet. The sweet aroma of cinnamon will complement the flavours of different fruit. If you wish to sweeten your salad, add honey instead of sugar to cope with the demands of PCOS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chewing cinnamon sticks:<\/strong>&nbsp;Try chewing some cinnamon sticks after your meal. Indian households have always been a huge fan of cinnamon. It is easy to find a container full of this aromatic stick in every Indian kitchen. The sweet and hot contrasting flavour of cinnamon is quite palatable. As an added benefit, cinnamon also aids in digestion and can reduce the fullness of the stomach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Honey cinnamon and lemon water:<\/strong> Drinking a concoction of lemon, cinnamon and honey in boiling water can help you in losing weight and reduce the effects of PCOS. To make this beneficial drink, boil a glass of water with a stick of cinnamon. Then add a spoon full of honey and a few drops of lemon. It is advisable to have this drink on an empty stomach in the morning.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>PCOD can be reversed using a holistic approach.
