But the challenge is that it\u2019s also often the hardest. \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/treat-pcos-naturally-inspiring-success-story\/\">PCOS <\/a>often leads to insulin resistance. This makes it difficult for the body to utilize glucose efficiently. The dual combination of unused insulin and unutilized glucose in blood leads to an imbalance of hormones. More specifically, it leads to an increase in the production of male hormones. And when male hormones go up, they lead to a range of problems. A common problem is weight gain, especially around the abdomen. Fat deposits around the abdomen make PCOS sufferers vulnerable to heart diseases.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Sadly, some doctors resort to shortcuts to reduce weight. Instead of advising holistic changes to diet and lifestyle, they end up prescribing medications. Orlistat is a commonly prescribed drug for PCOS weight loss.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While orlistat works for weight loss, like all medications, it has its side effects.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Side_Effects_of_Orlistat\">Side Effects of Orlistat<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Common_Orlistat_Side_Effects\">Common Orlistat Side Effects:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A change in your bowel routine<\/li>\n<li>Oily spotting or loose stools<\/li>\n<li>Bloating<\/li>\n<li>Light-colored stools<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty in controlling bowel movements<\/li>\n<li>Increased frequency of bowel movements<\/li>\n<li>Pain in the stomach and rectum<\/li>\n<li>Anxiety<\/li>\n<li>Headache<\/li>\n<li>Irregular menstruation<\/li>\n<li>Cold symptoms (stuffy nose, cough, sore throat, fever, chills)<\/li>\n<li>Severe lower back pain<\/li>\n<li>Bloody urine<\/li>\n<li>Infrequent urination<\/li>\n<li>Drowsiness<\/li>\n<li>Confusion<\/li>\n<li>Increased thirst<\/li>\n<li>Mood swings<\/li>\n<li>Swelling<\/li>\n<li>Shortness of breath<\/li>\n<li>Weight gain<\/li>\n<li>Severe pain in the upper stomach area<\/li>\n<li>Nausea<\/li>\n<li>Vomiting<\/li>\n<li>Yellowing of the skin and eyes<\/li>\n<li>Loss of appetite<\/li>\n<li>Dark-colored urine<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Side_Effects_If_You8217re_Allergic_to_Orlistat\">Side Effects If You&#8217;re Allergic to Orlistat:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hives<\/li>\n<li>Rash<\/li>\n<li>Itching<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty in breathing or swallowing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The most common short-term side effect of orlistat is irregular bowel movements.

If they persist, make sure the fat component in your meals does not exceed 30%. You can also ask your doctor to adjust dosage to help reduce side effects.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Does_Orlistat_Help_in_Reducing_Weight\">How Does Orlistat Help in Reducing Weight?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Our bodies have specific enzymes for digestion of fats. These enzymes are secreted by the stomach as well as the pancreas. Orlistat can bind to these enzymes and limit the digestion of fats. \u00a0This process makes them go right through the body without being absorbed. That\u2019s why you get the oily stools \u2013 stools which have a lot of fatty substance, are oily to look at and float in the toilet water.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Popular_Brands_of_Orlistat\">Popular Brands of Orlistat<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In many countries, Orlistat is available as a prescription drug as <em>Xenical. <\/em>The drug\u00a0contains 120 mg of the active compound in a capsule form. It is available as an over-the-counter drug under the brand name <em>Alli. <\/em>The OTC drug\u00a0contains 60 mg of the active compound. Xenical was a patented drug until 2009. Generic formulations are now sold in many countries under a variety of brand names like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Venustat (Iran)<\/li>\n<li>Orlean, Vyfat, Olistat, Obelit, Orlica, &amp; Reeshape (India)<\/li>\n<li>Xenalten, and Orsoten (Russia)<\/li>\n<li>Slimox (Austria)<\/li>\n<li>Cuvarlix (Malaysia)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Take_Orlistat\">How to Take Orlistat?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Orlistat is usually available as a capsule to be taken orally, three times a day if you\u2019re eating fat-rich meals. It can also be taken up to one hour after a meal. If you miss a meal or if you are eating a fat-free meal, you may skip the dose. Follow the instructions of your doctor, and do not take less or more of the drug than prescribed.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Is_Orlistat_Safe_In_the_Long_Term\">Is Orlistat Safe In the Long Term?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Orlistat impairs fat digestion. This means fat-soluble vitamins will not be absorbed by the body efficiently. Vitamins A, D, E, K are fat-soluble vitamins. To negate the side effects of orlistat, take a high-quality multivitamin two hours before or after taking the drug.<\/p>\n<p>In a study conducted at the University of Rhode Island, Professor Bingfang Yan found that orlistat<a href=\"https:\/\/today.uri.edu\/news\/pharmacy-researcher-finds-most-popular-weight-loss-drug-strongly-alters-other-drug-therapies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> also limits an enzyme called carboxylesterase-2<\/a>. This enzyme plays a vital role in the detoxification processes within the liver, kidneys as well as the digestive tract. Limiting the action of this enzyme can lead to severe liver failure and other serious conditions. In 2010, the<a href=\"https:\/\/livertox.nih.gov\/Orlistat.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> US FDA announced safety concerns<\/a> regarding the effect of orlistat on liver.

Orlistat also interacts with \u201cblood thinners\u201d like warfarin, anti-diabetic medications like glipzide, glyburide, metformin and insulin.

Divide the amounts of carbohydrates, fats and proteins evenly between three meals a day. Your fat intake per meal should not exceed 30%. Cut down on foods that contain fat greater than 30%. Add more grains, vegetables and fruits to your diet. Choose lean meat and cut down on portion size (eat around 2 to 3 ounces per meal). Eat low-fat dairy products and use less fat for cooking. Avoid pre-packaged and processed foods as they contain high amounts of fat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Very Important Note:<\/strong> Sepalika does not prescribe a low fat diet to most people. We believe that industrially processed vegetable oils, empty processed carbs and lack of good saturated fats in our diet are the core of several modern lifestyle diseases including PCOD.

Do not keep it in humid places (the bathroom, for example). Do not refrigerate the medicine. Store the container in a dry place away from excess light and heat.<\/p>\n<p>Always store medicines away from young children and pets. Unused and expired medicines should be disposed of in ways that they do not get consumed by pets, children and other people. Never flush the medicines. If you are not sure about the disposal of the medicine, take it back to your pharmacist.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Orlistat_Side_Effects_The_Final_Verdict\">Orlistat Side Effects: The Final Verdict<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Obesity is a major problem in women with PCOS. While PCOS itself is a frustrating disorder to contend with, obesity brings along with it the risks of many serious health complications like cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. It is thus important to manage weight.<\/p>\n<p>While weight loss drugs like orlistat seem to help reduce weight, reviews of several studies show that the average weight loss with orlistat is a mere 7 pounds more than when the drug isn\u2019t used. Most people eventually gain the weight after they stop taking orlistat. The question then is whether it is worth taking the risk of all the above-mentioned short term and serious long term side effects to lose 7 pounds more over a period of more than one year?<\/p>\n<p>We agree that losing weight is difficult and what is even more difficult is to stay off the lost pounds. But the <strong>role of orlistat in PCOS<\/strong> should not be overestimated. A disciplined and a sustainable diet and lifestyle plan can help in effectively reducing weight which can be maintained. For those who are keen to lose weight as a major part of their PCOS therapy, it is advisable to consider intermittent fasting and an<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/diet-for-pcos\/\"> LCHF diet<\/a>. Both these lifestyle changes have shown to have substantial benefits for people with insulin resistance and diabetes.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
