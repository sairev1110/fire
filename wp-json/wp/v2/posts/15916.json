Women suffering from PCOS may face irregular periods, acne and excess facial hair, weight gain, and even mood swings and depression, from adolescence to menopause.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOS can get worse with time if not treated correctly. Indian home remedies for PCOS have always backed us through almost all our major and minor health problems. Regular use of these remedies has been found to be of great help in managing the symptoms of PCOS.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Indian_Home_Remedies\"><strong>Indian Home Remedies<\/strong><br><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Women with PCOS often have other issues like insulin resistance, obesity, high cholesterol and even infertility. High levels of insulin may lead to excess male hormones, which in turn leads to disturbed menstrual cycles and several of the hormonal problems mentioned above.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, patients have begun to trust alternative medicine more, as awareness about the side effects of chemical drugs has increased. Indian Home Remedies for PCOS can be trusted to be free from side effects and minimize the symptoms of PCOS to a great extent on regular use. Following is a list of some of the most used home remedies over the generations:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Fenugreek_Trigonella_foenum-greacum_L\"><strong>Fenugreek <em>(Trigonella foenum-greacum L.)<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fenugreek (known as <em>methi<\/em> in Hindi) is one such ingredient which can be easily found in our kitchen and has been used over the generations for its benefits. The seeds of fenugreek have anti-diabetic effects in humans. Since women with PCOS are often prescribed the anti-diabetic medicine metformin, <em>methi<\/em>, which has a similar effect on insulin resistance can also be used for PCOS. Fenugreek promotes regular menstrual cycles.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Cinnamon\"><strong>Cinnamon<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A common spice that has been in use since biblical times, it has been found to have insulin-sensitizing effects. It increases insulin sensitivity and also helps curb cravings for sweets when used as a water-infusion. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Flax_seeds\"><strong>Flax seeds<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Flaxseed contains several biologically-active compounds like alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), lignans, soluble flaxseed fiber mucilage which has significant health benefits. Flaxseed supplementation results in significant improvement in ovarian function and menstrual cycle. Women with PCOD often have too much of the hormone oestrogen (in addition to testosterone) and flax seeds prevent over-activity of oestrogens, helping to reduce PCOS symptoms.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Tulsi\"><strong>Tulsi<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (Lamiaceae)<\/em> is a traditional herbal medicine commonly known as Tulsi. It reduces excess male hormone action. It is also useful in the management of body weight.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Amla_Emblica_officinalis\"><strong>Amla <em>(Emblica officinalis)<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps to protect the heart health of women with PCOS.  <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Turmeric_Curcuma_longa\"><strong>Turmeric<em> (Curcuma longa)<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps in lowering high levels of fat in the body and hence also helps with the management of weight in women with PCOS.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Atibala_Abutilon_indicum\"><strong>Atibala <em>(Abutilon indicum)<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It corrects hormonal disturbances and facilitates avoiding miscarriage.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Pudina_Mentha_spicata\"><strong>Pudina<em> (Mentha spicata)<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It has an anti-androgenic property which helps in controlling the elevated levels of male hormones.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Aloe_vera\"><strong>Aloe vera<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It restores glucose sensitivity which in turn reduces insulin resistance and controls high levels of insulin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Neem_Azadirachta_indica\"><strong>Neem <em>(Azadirachta indica)<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;It has anti-diabetic property.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Yashtimadhu_Glycyrrhiza_glabra\"><strong>Yashtimadhu <em>(Glycyrrhiza glabra)<\/em><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It reduces serum testosterone and helps reduce excess male hair in women with PCOS.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These home remedies, when used regularly, give significant positive results. Women find that their body weight, insulin levels, male hormone levels, levels of FSH and SHBG, etc. are all positively impacted. Over time, women with PCOS who wish to conceive are also helped by these home remedies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn how to use Ayurvedic remedies effectively to combat PCOD with Sepalika\u2019s 5-Petal PCOD Programme.
