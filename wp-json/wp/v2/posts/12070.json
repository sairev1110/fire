Many of them have chronic acid reflux, which is called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. 10% of Americans develop painful ulcers as a result. Ulcers are painful sores or breaks in the lining of the esophagus or stomach or duodenum (the uppermost part of the small intestine that joins to the lower end of the stomach). Chronic acid reflux or GERD is a major risk factor for ulcers.<\/p>\n<p>An ulcer is formed when the thick mucosal layer that protects the sensitive cells lining the inside of the stomach (or esophagus or duodenum) is eroded, exposing the internal delicate cell lining. The digestive juices eat away at the exposed lining to cause a wound\u00a0or an ulcer. Duodenal ulcers are the most common, followed by stomach ulcers and finally esophageal ulcers, which are comparatively rare.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Symptoms_of_Ulcers\">Symptoms of Ulcers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>How severe the symptoms are will depend upon how severe your ulcer is. The most common symptom is a severe pain or a burning sensation in the area between the chest and navel (belly button). Pain is intense when the stomach is empty and can last for a few minutes to a few hours.<\/p>\n<p>Other signs and symptoms that can be experienced include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weight loss<\/li>\n<li>Persistent dull pain in the stomach<\/li>\n<li>Nausea or vomiting (blood is sometimes seen in the vomit)<\/li>\n<li>Bloody or tarry black stools<\/li>\n<li>Heartburn<\/li>\n<li>Bloating and gassiness<\/li>\n<li>Not feeling like eating (because of the pain)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Causes_of_Ulcers\">Causes of Ulcers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>An ulcer is caused when the stomach acid and other digestive enzymes eat away at the inner lining of the digestive tract. The digestive lining is covered with a thick mucosal layer that protects against acid. An ulcer could develop if (a) the amount of acid increases, or (b) the mucosal layer thickness is reduced. The most common causes of ulcers include GERD, an H. pylori infection and regular use of certain medications.<\/p>\n<p>GERD often causes inflammation of the esophagus, called esophagitis. Chronic esophagitis may cause esophageal ulcers. Constant backflow of acid from the stomach erodes the lining of the esophagus causing ulcers. Esophageal ulcers can be shallow or deep, depending on the severity of the acid reflux.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4017034\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Helicobacter pylori<\/a> is known to cause gastric and duodenal ulcers. H. pylori is a bacterium that is notorious in causing many digestive problems including GERD and dyspepsia. It creates an environment of low acid within the stomach so that it can thrive. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/why-gerd-happens\/\">Low stomach acid <\/a>is now well recognized as a cause of GERD. The bacterium colonizes within the mucosal layer and reduces its thickness. It causes inflammation of the underlying tissue lining and also exposes it to the stomach\u2019s acid and digestive enzymes.<\/p>\n<p>Certain medications like NSAIDs (over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen), steroids, aspirin, etc. can increase your chances of developing an ulcer.<\/p>\n<p>Hyperacidity in the stomach, due to lifestyle factors (like stress and smoking), certain foods and genetics (like having Zollinger \u2013Ellison syndrome, a rare disease in which the stomach makes more acid) can also cause ulcers.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Complications_of_Ulcers_Why_You_Should_Not_Allow_Your_GERD_To_Cause_Ulcers\">Complications of Ulcers: Why You Should Not Allow Your GERD To Cause Ulcers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Ulcers often bleed. If the surface lining of the ulcer is involved, there may be a slow and constant loss of blood into the digestive tract. It may appear as tarry black or bloody stools. Over time, anemia may develop if the condition isn\u2019t treated. If the ulcers are larger and deeper, they may damage a larger blood vessel. In such a case, the blood loss can be severe and without prompt medical attention, the person may bleed to death.<\/p>\n<p>Ulcers may lead to a \u201cleaky gut.\u201d When the ulcers eat into the stomach lining, they cause perforations, or small holes. While this is a less frequent complication, it does happen. And when it does, the stomach starts leaking partially digested food, digestive enzymes and more importantly, gut bacteria. All of these particles can activate an immune response to cause inflammation while the bacteria may cause infection.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases of duodenal ulcers, the ulcer can swell enough to cause an obstruction to the passage of food during the process of digestion. This condition is called gastric outlet obstruction and its symptoms include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>frequent vomiting large amounts of undigested food<\/li>\n<li>a persistent feeling that the stomach is full<\/li>\n<li>unexplained weight loss, and<\/li>\n<li>feeling full even after consuming less than adequate food.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Treating_Ulcers\">Treating Ulcers<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19627\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Treating-Ulcers.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19627\" class=\"wp-image-19627 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Treating-Ulcers.webp\" alt=\"Treating Ulcers\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19627\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Treating Ulcers<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Treatment of ulcers will depend upon what is causing it.
