If you are on a strict LCHF Diet (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/low-carb-high-fat-myths\/\">low carb-high fat<\/a>) or a Keto Diet, you may even be cutting out ALL fruit from your diet. It\u2019s true \u2013 fruits are high in carbs and natural sugars. But there is one fruit that works well with any low-carb diet &#8212; and that&#8217;s the humble strawberry. Let&#8217;s look at the amount of carbs in strawberries and the many benefits of this fruit.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Many_Carbs_Are_In_Strawberries\">How Many Carbs Are In Strawberries?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Like any other fruit, there are some carbs in strawberries. However, as a fruit rich in water and fiber, these have low total carb content. There are less than 8 grams of carbs in strawberries (100 grams.) To put this in perspective, 100 grams of bananas have 23 grams of carbs (that&#8217;s nearly 4 times the arbs in strawberries.)<\/p>\n<p>These carbs in strawberries are in the form of simple sugars like glucose, sucrose, and fructose. So, 100 grams of strawberries contain only 32 calories because they contain 91% water.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"6_Amazing_Benefits_Of_Strawberries\">6 Amazing Benefits Of Strawberries<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Apart from keeping your carb intake in check, there are numerous benefits of adding this fruit to your diet.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rich_in_Fiber\">Rich in Fiber<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The carbs in strawberries contain 26% fiber, which is why the net carb content of a cup of the fruit is so low. Each cup of whole strawberries contains 3 grams of dietary fiber \u2013 a mix of both soluble and insoluble fiber. These fibers help improve gut health and aid in healthy digestion. They also ensure that the simple sugars contained in them are absorbed in the blood slowly, preventing blood sugar spikes.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Low_Glycemic_Index_and_Glycemic_Load\">Low Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Strawberries have a low Glycemic Index (GI) of 40, which makes them safe for diabetics. Also, they have a very low Glycemic Load (GL) &#8212; half a cup has a GL of only 1.5. Glycemic Load takes into account the relationship between serving size and carbohydrate content. GL\u00a0may be a better indicator of how any food containing carbs affects blood sugar levels. The antioxidants in them (namely ellagitannins and ellagic acid) add to the many benefits of strawberries. These antioxidants have good potential for the management of hyperglycemia and hypertension linked to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/\"> type 2 diabetes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Packed_With_Nutrients\">Packed With Nutrients<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Strawberries are rich in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/benefits-vitamin-c\/\">Vitamin C<\/a>, which makes them excellent for skin and immune health. They also contain manganese, potassium, and folate (Vitamin B9) which are all important for essential body functions. They are loaded with plant antioxidants and other compounds, which offer numerous health benefits by fighting against free radicals.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Enhance_Brain_Health\">Enhance Brain Health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Strawberries are rich in <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mnfr.200700002\/full\">natural anthocyanin antioxidants<\/a>, which help boost brain function. They also help reduce advancing age-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and diverse degenerative diseases. Degenerative diseases are problems that worsen with time. Berry anthocyanins also improve neuronal and cognitive brain functions and eye health.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fight_Against_Inflammation\">Fight Against Inflammation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While the fiber in strawberries prevents blood sugar spikes, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/british-journal-of-nutrition\/article\/strawberry-anthocyanin-and-its-association-with-postprandial-inflammation-and-insulin\/FED139EE31DA31AC60C82F231C82EBEA\">anthocyanin antioxidants also work well for postprandial inflammation and insulin sensitivity<\/a>. Benefits of strawberries also include a natural reduction in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood which causes inflammation. This makes them a must-add to your anti-inflammatory diet.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Improve_Heart_Health\">Improve Heart Health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The phytochemicals in strawberries, particularly anthocyanins and ellagic acid, have been associated with significant heart\u00a0health benefits. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/nutritionj.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1475-2891-8-43\">study published in Nutrition Journal 2009<\/a>, Freeze-dried Strawberry Powder improved lipid profile and lipid peroxidation in 16 women with metabolic syndrome. By consuming 2 cups of the strawberry drink daily for 4 weeks, their total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lowered by the end of the study.<\/p>\n<p>The many antioxidants and flavonoids in the fruit can also help improve bone health, promote healthy weight loss, fight against oxidative stress, protect against premature signs of aging, and have even been linked to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11181460\">cancer prevention<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Select_and_Store_Strawberries\">How to Select and Store Strawberries?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20540\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/How-to-Select-and-Store-Strawberries.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20540\" class=\"wp-image-20540 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/How-to-Select-and-Store-Strawberries.webp\" alt=\"Low Carb Diet\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20540\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to Select and Store Strawberries<\/p><\/div>\n<p>For maximum health benefits, it\u2019s always a good idea to buy organic strawberries. Since these ripe red berries are very vulnerable to mold, regular crops are often treated with a lot of pesticides to increase their shelf life.<\/p>\n<p>Look for perfectly ripe ones \u2013 these are the tastiest and the most nutrient-packed. Once picked, strawberries do not ripen further, so you want to avoid under-ripe or over-ripe berries. Strawberries that have been picked before they ripen to perfection are often dull in color and sour in taste. Overripe berries don\u2019t taste good either.<\/p>\n<p>The best strawberries are those bought locally when the fruit is in-season. Yes, you can buy them almost all through the year these days, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to get the best quality. Strawberries sold out-of-season or shipped long distances often have to be picked before they ripen, so they don\u2019t pack the same nutritional (or flavor) punch as the perfect ripe fruit. If strawberries are not in season, you\u2019d be better off with a bag of Fresh &amp; Frozen strawberries as compared to the out-of-season offerings at the fresh aisle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are 5 tips for picking up the best strawberries:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look for berries that are bright red and without any green, white or yellow discoloring.<\/li>\n<li>When buying packed strawberries, make sure there are no signs of mold or rotting fruit in the pack.<\/li>\n<li>Once home, open up the pack of berries immediately. If you find a couple of rotting berries hidden in your pack, its best to discard them immediately.<\/li>\n<li>Always store them in the refrigerator. Wash every portion size right before you want to eat them.<\/li>\n<li>If you aren\u2019t going to eat them within a couple of days, its best to put them in a freezer-safe bag and freeze them. Wash them gently, remove the green caps, and allow the berries to dry completely before freezing them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Fresh strawberries can be frozen for up to 6 months. So buy a large batch of local strawberry in season, and store them for the next 6 months by freezing them.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"A_Word_Of_Caution\">A Word Of Caution<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Some people can be allergic to strawberries. This is especially important for those with pollen-food allergy. Strawberry allergy can cause swelling of the lips, mouth and tongue, or hives, rash, headaches, and in severe cases, breathing problems.\u00a0If you do have food allergies and are trying strawberries for the first time, consult a medical expert before having them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 How Many Carbs Are In Strawberries?2 6 Amazing Benefits Of Strawberries2.1 Rich in Fiber2.2 Low Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load2.3 Packed With Nutrients2.4 Enhance Brain Health2.5 Fight Against Inflammation2.6 Improve Heart Health3 How to Select and Store Strawberries?3.1 A Word Of Caution One of the biggest challenges of a low-carb diet is [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24,"featured_media":20541,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[69],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Strawberries: Low In Carbs And High In Benefits | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Strawberries are the perfect low-carb fruit.
