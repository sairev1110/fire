A natural compound called histamine may be to blame. And that&#8217;s the hint for what is histamine intolerance.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Is_Histamine_A_Key_Immune_Player_And_All-Round_Star\">What Is Histamine: A Key Immune Player And All-Round Star!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Histamine is a natural chemical produced in the body. When there\u2019s an injury or an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/allergies\/adaptogens-for-seasonal-allergies\/\">allergic <\/a>or inflammatory reaction, histamine is released in the body by mast cells, a type of white blood cell. The bacteria in our gut also produce histamine and that is why they are so critical to our immune health.<\/p>\n<p>When it\u2019s on immune duty, histamine works by helping cell walls become more porous, so that chemicals needed to fight the invader can move about freely and do their job efficiently. If you\u2019ve ever had a bout of allergic sneezing and a runny nose, you have first-hand experience of what histamine intolerance is.<\/p>\n<p>While histamine plays a huge role in the immune system, it has also been found to participate in at least 22 other physiological functions in the body to date. It plays a key role in digestion, by helping to stimulate and regulate stomach acid production. As a neurotransmitter, it relays important messages between the body and brain, too. During stressful times, it acts as a vasodilator\u2014meaning it expands our blood vessels\u2014to bring down blood pressure. As you can see, it\u2019s essential for our health and survival.<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote-text-new\">&#8220;Histamine is essential for our health and survival, And yet, it can harm when it is more than what we can handle.&#8221;<\/div>\n<p>And yet, the body keeps a tight watch on the amount of histamine floating around. When it\u2019s not needed, it is either safely \u201cstored away\u201d or rapidly broken down, so the body can go back to being non-allergic and non-inflamed\u2014to a more peaceful state.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Too_Much_Of_A_Good_Thing_Histamine_Tolerance_Levels_Vary_From_Person_to_Person\">Too Much Of A Good Thing: Histamine Tolerance Levels Vary From Person to Person<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18483\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Histamine-3-2nd-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18483\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18483\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Histamine-3-2nd-image.webp\" alt=\"Histamine intolerance is due to a deficiency or an inhibition of the enzyme Diamine Oxidase (DAO)\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18483\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Histamine intolerance is due to a deficiency or an inhibition of the enzyme Diamine Oxidase (DAO)<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Remember:<\/strong> Foods contain histamine too. So when the total amount of histamine in our body\u2014the sum of what is produced internally and what is obtained from foods\u2014gets to be more than what our body can handle, the histamine bucket \u201coverflows,\u201d and we experience the symptoms of histamine intolerance.<\/p>\n<p>When this overflow happens will vary from person to person.<\/p>\n<p>Some lucky people can eat lots of histamine-containing foods and never have an issue because their body has no problem breaking it down. It could also be that their gut bacteria produce low levels of histamine, so they are safe.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas others can eat only small amounts and still have a problem because they lack the necessary enzymes (called diamine oxidase and n-methyltransferase) to break the histamine down. Histamine reactions are also possible because their body is already producing too much histamine from gut bacteria, overall inflammation, or stress, so even a little more from food can tip them over.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Did_I_Get_Into_This_Histamine_Intolerance_Mess_Suddenly\">How Did I Get Into This Histamine Intolerance Mess Suddenly?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Most of us are quite surprised when we have a reaction to food. \u201cWhy me?\u201d \u201cWhy now?\u201d are often asked questions.<\/p>\n<p>There are several likely reasons, and many times, they overlap. It ranges from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/sibo-complication-gerd\/\">SIBO <\/a>(small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), gut dysbiosis (meaning too many bad bacteria and not enough good ones in your gut), inflammation, genuine allergies, stress, overuse of medications, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Our gut is supposed to degrade histamine using an enzyme called diamine oxidase, or DAO. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the histamine gets shuttled to the liver and other areas, where histamine then has to be processed.<\/p>\n<p>Some people may have low DAO from birth, whereas others may develop an issue with it after a lifetime of high-carbohydrate processed foods\u2014a diet that can throw off the gut bacteria in such a way that there are too many histamine-producing bacterial strains, and not enough histamine-degrading strains.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/allergies\/histamine-intolerance-symptoms\/\">The symptoms of histamine intolerance<\/a> are easy to spot and there are specific foods you can avoid, to help yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Know more about our program :<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\">Bounce Back from PCOD, Naturally<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Red wine, chocolate, cheese, strawberries, avocado. <\/p>\n<p>These may sound like your favorite foods, but for some, they have a more insidious side.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":29,"featured_media":18484,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[88],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What is Histamine Intolerance?<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"What is Histamine intolerance?
