Me neither! Some days, a Cup o\u2019 Joe is the only thing keeping me from crawling back into bed, wishing my whole life was a long weekend. Yet, if you are a woman with PCOS, you might be wondering if coffee should be a part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-diet\/\">PCOS diet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re not surprised you\u2019re confused! Truth is \u2013 there are conflicting points of view when it comes to coffee and\u00a0PCOS. Some PCOS experts insist that you must eliminate coffee from your PCOS diet completely, while others recommend it in moderation. So what is the truth? Should you, or should you not, drink coffee with PCOS? Let&#8217;s understand by looking at how coffee affects some key <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/what-causes-pcos\/\">causes <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-symptoms\/\">symptoms of PCOS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Coffee_and_Insulin_Resistance\">Coffee and Insulin Resistance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The evidence on whether or not coffee should not be a part of a healthy diet is sketchy. A lot of the confusion centers around insulin sensitivity, and how caffeine may affect it. To be honest, the scientific data on this is contradictory and can be confusing.<\/p>\n<p>Research from Nestl\u00e9 Research Center, Switzerland found that when lifestyle confounders are taken into account, individuals consuming \u22656 cups coffee per day have at least 50% less risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes than those consuming \u22642 cups per day. However, scientists agreed that it is perhaps premature to recommend increased coffee or caffeine intake to prevent the development of Type 2 Diabetes or insulin resistance.<\/p>\n<p>Another Canadian study had similar findings. In a cross-sectional study, caffeinated coffee was positively related to insulin sensitivity.\u00a0 And decaffeinated coffee was favourably related to measures of beta cell (which produces insulin) function. Researchers concluded that these results provide insight as to how coffee could impact the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.<\/p>\n<p>However, a study from University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands found contradictory results. When caffeine or placebo was given to 12 healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, it was found that caffeine did indeed decrease insulin sensitivity in healthy humans. It\u2019s possible that this was the result of elevated plasma epinephrine levels due to coffee intake.<\/p>\n<p>Though all this scientific data is contradicting, we have some answers for you. This is what happens when you drink a cup of coffee:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coffee has an immediate effect on insulin sensitivity. It makes your body insulin resistant soon after drinking a cup.<\/li>\n<li>However, in the long term, regular coffee consumption improves insulin sensitivity and significantly reduces the risk of Type 2 diabetes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, this means that coffee imparts some insulin balancing benefits to regular and habitual coffee drinkers. What\u2019s interesting to note is that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee drinkers may enjoy a reduced risk of Diabetes Type 2, suggesting that it\u2019s not essentially \u2018caffeine\u2019 but some other compound in coffee that\u2019s the secret behind these benefits.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Coffee_and_Fertility\">Coffee and Fertility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A lot of women with PCOS trying to get pregnant worry about the effects of caffeine on fertility. Truth is, the potential effects of coffee consumption on fertility are not clearly established but appear to be quite limited. Some <a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/aje\/article\/145\/4\/324\/69064\/Caffeine-Intake-and-Delayed-Conception-A-European\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research<\/a> indicates that high levels of caffeine intake may delay conception among fertile women. Considering that PCOS already makes it harder for you to get pregnant, it may not be wise to add to your fertility woes with your coffee addiction.<\/p>\n<p>There is also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002-9378(07)02025-X\/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strong evidence<\/a> that coffee can increase your risk for miscarriage. The study of 1,063 pregnant women found that women who consumed 200 mg or more of caffeine per day doubled their miscarriage risk. What\u2019s worrisome is that PCOS already puts you at increased risk of miscarriage in your first trimester. Now if you are trying to get pregnant, or are already pregnant, it may be best to eliminate coffee from your PCOS pregnancy diet for this reason alone.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Coffee_and_Hormones\">Coffee and Hormones<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>PCOS is characterized by hormonal imbalance, and coffee may be able to help in this regard\u2026.to some extent, anyways.\u00a0 Caffeinated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3012180\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coffee has been positively associated with SHBG<\/a> or Sex Hormone Binding Globulin \u2013 a protein produced in the liver. SHBG binds with excess androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) as well as estrogen so that they become inactive and harmless.<\/p>\n<p>Now women with PCOS sometimes have low SHBG levels, which is what causes an increase in active testosterone and estrogen in the blood. A cup of coffee can boost SHBG levels so that these circulating testosterone and estrogen become ineffective, improving your PCOS symptoms.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Coffee_and_Adrenals\">Coffee and Adrenals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t celebrate just yet, coz now we have some bad news for you. Caffeine can strongly affect the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a growing body of evidence that shows PCOS patients have a hyper-responsive HPA or Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland located in the brain control the adrenal glands which produces male hormones (androgens) like DHEA as well as cortisol. Disturbances in the HPA axis leads to excess androgen production, stress, increased abdominal fat, impaired glucose sensitivity and insulin resistance.<\/p>\n<p>The adrenal glands secrete two key hormones: epinephrine and cortisol.\u00a0Research has shown that caffeine increases cortisol and epinephrine at rest, stressing out the adrenal glands. In fact, levels of cortisol after caffeine consumption are similar to those experienced during an acute stress response. Caffeine raises blood pressure and also increases levels of free epinephrine excreted by up to 32%. \u00a0This increase in blood pressure and heart rate has been associated with higher levels of self-reported stress during the activities of the day. It\u2019s believed that even if you stick to drinking coffee only in the morning up till early afternoon, these effects are undiminished through the evening until bedtime. Studies have also shed light on the fact that caffeine may elevate cortisol by stimulating the central nervous system in men but may interact with peripheral metabolic mechanisms in women.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put \u2013 coffee can worsen adrenal fatigue. This happens when your adrenal glands are weakened over time, causing chronic lethargy, hormonal disruption, anxiousness and irritability.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"So_Should_Coffee_Be_a_Part_of_Your_PCOS_Diet\">So, Should Coffee Be a Part of Your PCOS Diet?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20484\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Coffee-for-PCOS-1st-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20484\" class=\"wp-image-20484 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Coffee-for-PCOS-1st-image.webp\" alt=\"coffee and pcos\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20484\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coffee Be a Part of Your PCOS Diet<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Well, as you can see, there\u2019s no straight answer to that question. Whether the pros outweigh the cons of coffee is a personal decision, one that should be made keeping in mind your individual PCOS symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>In my opinion, it may be a good idea to review your relationship with coffee. Caffeine in coffee is a highly addictive substance. If you\u2019re drinking more than 3 cups of coffee per day, and can\u2019t seem to think straight without them, I would consider taming that coffee addiction. Personally, I like to limit myself to one cup a day on most days. And when I\u2019m extra-stressed out, I omit coffee completely from my routine. I haven\u2019t committed to giving up coffee completely, though.<\/p>\n<p>Here are my 5 tips for ensuring your coffee addiction is not detrimental for your PCOS:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Limit your coffee intake to maximum 2 cups a day; lesser the better.<\/li>\n<li>Drink your second cup of coffee by afternoon, and don\u2019t save it for when you get home from work. Caffeine interferes with a peaceful night\u2019s sleep, so you want to ensure you are done with it by 3pm. On average, it takes the body up to 8 hours to process the caffeine, so you want to create that buffer before bedtime.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t depend on Starbucks for your daily cup o\u2019 joe. Those cappuccinos, lattes and macchiato are laden with hundreds of extra calories you don\u2019t need! That extra sugar, syrup, and cream will definitely cause a spike in your blood sugar levels, and you don\u2019t want that. Instead, brew a cup of coffee at home, and drink it black. Or with a bit of almond milk, if you must.<\/li>\n<li>If you are suffering from adrenal fatigue, it\u2019s important to eliminate coffee from your diet. It will only make you jittery and shaky, and further stress out your adrenals. Your body needs a break, and some time to heal. Try some natural ways to beat stress, and then reintroduce coffee into your diet when you\u2019re feeling better.<\/li>\n<li>Definitely cut back on coffee if you\u2019re trying to get pregnant and make it an occasional treat. Once you are pregnant, its best to avoid coffee until your baby is born.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Coffee is a polarizing topic\u00a0in the PCOS community; hence it\u2019s difficult to find any concrete answers to your conundrum. However, we recommend that you limit your coffee intake with PCOS. It\u2019s best to err on the side of caution with this one.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
