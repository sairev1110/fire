Exercise is one of the best ways to improve your overall health. Research has repeatedly shown that it can help diabetics bring their diabetes under control through a variety of body mechanisms. There is also a deep connection between <strong>exercise and type 2 diabetes prevention<\/strong> as a fit and healthy body isn&#8217;t prone to lifestyle disorders like diabetes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts agree that to move the needle on diabetes through exercise, you need do either do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thirty minutes of \u2018moderate intensity\u2019 aerobic activity (i.e. \u201ccardio\u201d), five days a week,<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Or<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u2018Vigorous intensity\u2019 aerobic activity, 20 minutes or more a day<strong>,<\/strong> 3-5 days a week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>In addition to this, you should add flexibility and strength training to your routine:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Flexibility activities 5-7 days a week.<\/li>\n<li>Strength training: 8-10 exercises, 10-15 repetitions of each exercise, 2-3 days a week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"Controlling_Type_2_Diabetes_With_Exercise\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"Controlling_Type_2_Diabetes_With_Exercise\">Controlling Type 2 Diabetes With Exercise<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Work with your diabetes educator or your doctor to create a plan that works for you.

However, many people find it easier to schedule fewer longer sessions rather than five or more weekly shorter sessions. Ideally, there should not be more than two consecutive days without aerobic physical activity.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What_If_I_Exercise_Longer_Than_30_Minutes\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"What_If_I_Exercise_Longer_Than_30_Minutes\">What If I Exercise Longer Than 30 Minutes?<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Longer or more intense exercise can help you improve your diabetes parameters even more; but it could also cause your blood glucose to drop more than shorter or easier exercise. You may need to have a carbohydrate snack after 20-30 minutes of intense exercise.<\/li>\n<li>Blood glucose may continue to drop for several hours after activity. Monitor it, especially in the earlier stages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"Could_I_Be_Sensitive_to_Exercise\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"Could_I_Be_Sensitive_to_Exercise\">Could I Be \u201cSensitive\u201d to Exercise?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being sensitive to exercise means that your blood glucose has a tendency to drop suddenly when you exercise and your insulin sensitivity improves. You could feel any of these symptoms, suddenly.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>If you feel that you are sensitive to exercise, your doctor or diabetes educator may suggest that you lower your pre-exercise insulin dose.<\/li>\n<li>If you do not adjust your insulin before you exercise, eat or drink 15 grams of carbohydrate for every 20 minutes of physical activity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"When_Is_The_Best_Time_of_Day_to_Exercise\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"When_Is_The_Best_Time_of_Day_to_Exercise\">When Is The Best Time of Day to Exercise?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18903\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Exercise-and-diabetes.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18903\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18903\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Exercise-and-diabetes.webp\" alt=\"How does exercise help diabetes\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18903\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How does exercise help diabetes<\/p><\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Any time is a good time! You will get healthy and fit no matter when you work out, but here are some important things to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research shows that exercising in the morning may cause your blood glucose to drop lesser than if you exercised later in the day.<\/li>\n<li>If you are on insulin or taking meds that work by making your body secrete more insulin, evening exercise may result in low blood glucose levels while you sleep, so be aware of this and exercise care.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"What_If_I_Have_Already_Had_Episodes_of_Low_Blood_Glucose_Levels\">What If I Have Already Had Episodes of Low Blood Glucose Levels?<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>If so, you are more likely to develop symptoms of low blood glucose after exercise.<\/li>\n<li>If you exercise in the evening, you may need to have a carbohydrate snack before going to bed to prevent a low blood glucose reaction while you sleep.<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re on insulin and you exercise at night, you may need to take a lower dose at bedtime. Do check with your doctor to monitor\/fine tune your dose.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"Aerobic_Exercise_to_Help_Diabetes_Or_Strength_Training_Using_Weights\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"Aerobic_Exercise_to_Help_Diabetes_Or_Strength_Training_Using_Weights\">Aerobic Exercise to Help Diabetes Or Strength Training (Using Weights)?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aerobic training involves continuous activity of multiple large muscle groups, whereas strength training involves isolated, brief activity of single muscle groups. All of the activities we have suggested above are aerobic activities. The first exercise advice that most doctors give you is usually aerobic exercise related. This is because it also increases cardio-respiratory fitness and has been proven over the years to reduce diabetes lab markers, including HbA1c and cholesterol in various studies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Strength training increases muscle strength and endurance. For the point of view of diabetes, it is also equally effective in reducing the very same lab markers \u2013 HbA1c, bad cholesterol, etc. Insulin resistance responds well to strength training or using weights. The reason this kind of exercise is not easily recommended by your doctor is because if you have never done it in your life, it is better done under supervision to avoid injuries. Not everyone has access to a trainer or can afford one, so it is not freely recommended to diabetics.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A meta study (a study of other research studies on the subject) of the effects of exercise on diabetes was conducted by the American Diabetes Association in 2006. It showed that the combined effect of using aerobic exercise and resistance training in combination may well be the best of both worlds for diabetics. So, if you are someone who is either familiar with exercising with weights or have access to a local gym or center where someone can teach you the correct form, you should consider adding it to your routine twice a week. High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) using weights can really help you hasten your progress on diabetes.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Using_Weights_How_to_Go_About_it\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"Using_Weights_How_to_Go_About_it\">Using Weights: How to Go About it<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>High-resistance exercise using weights may be more acceptable to younger people with diabetes; if you feel you don\u2019t fall in this category, seek expert help to help you pick what works for you.<\/li>\n<li>Unless contraindicated by expert medical opinion, most people are fit enough to perform resistance exercises, using light weights and high repetitions, targeting all major muscle groups, three times a week. Ensure you do the exercises correctly; do them strictly under the supervision of a trainer or at least learn them with one.<\/li>\n<li>Have periodic reassessments done by a qualified exercise specialist. This will maximize health benefits, and minimize the risk of injury.<\/li>\n<li>Always start low and slowly build up your strength, with resistance training or weight training. You can see our sample Strength Training Table for the sorts of weight training exercises you can do, using different muscle groups on different days of the week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Here are some examples of strength training activities you could do<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Weight machines or free weights at the gym<\/li>\n<li>Using resistance bands<\/li>\n<li>Lifting light weights or objects like canned goods or water bottles at home<\/li>\n<li>Calisthenics or exercises that use your own body weight to work your muscles (examples are pushups, sit ups, squats, lunges, wall-sits and planks)<\/li>\n<li>Classes that involve strength training<\/li>\n<li>Other activities that build and maintain muscles, like heavy gardening<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"All_Set_Heres_A_Plan_to_Follow\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"All_Set_Heres_A_Plan_to_Follow\">All Set?
