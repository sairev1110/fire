Their headache bouts often get worse when they are also experiencing heartburn.<\/p>\n<p>A large questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study that assessed more than 43,000 patients found a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18197884\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">higher prevalence of headache<\/a> in individuals with acid reflux and other digestive complaints.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The study, which was published in an international journal of headache, concluded that a higher headache frequency was associated with a greater risk of gastrointestinal problems.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why should a digestive ailment cause pain at the other end of the body?

So, if you have POTS, you will likely suffer from GERD and you will also have headaches that worsen when you are in the midst of an acid reflux bout.<\/p>\n<p>POTS affects both men and women equally and is seen between the ages of 15 to 50, often immediately after a trauma, a major surgery or viral infection. However, every person who suffers from GERD, and also has headaches might not necessarily be a victim of POTS.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Can_Bad_Digestion_Lead_To_Headaches\">Can Bad Digestion Lead To Headaches?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re not suffering from POTS, there is another possible explanation for headaches. When you suffer from GERD, your stomach\u2019s acidity is usually low. In a stomach with low acidity, digestion does not occur efficiently.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related article: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/know-affects-stomach-acid-production\/\">6 Factors Affecting The Production Of Stomach Acid<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is because organisms like <em>H. pylori<\/em> have overgrown in an environment where there shouldn\u2019t be any bacteria (after all, who can grow and thrive in a bottle of concentrated hydrochloric acid?!). These bacteria ferment (rot) the food that should be digested and cause formation of large amounts of noxious gases. These gases increase pressure within the stomach and cause bloating. They also put pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and force it to open upwards, thereby spilling acidic stomach contents inside the esophagus, causing heartburn. The LES is a muscular valve that guards the entrance of the esophagus into the stomach. It allows swallowed food to enter the stomach but, under normal circumstances, does not allow backflow of stomach contents.<\/p>\n<p>These noxious gases permeate the fluids and sinuses, and enter our brain and expand. Expansion of these gases puts pressure on the walls of the brain causing headaches. These bouts of headaches persist until these gases are removed by normal bodily processes. This also explains why headaches worsen when acid reflux is in progress.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Taking_a_Pill_for_Your_Headache_Will_Not_Address_the_Root_Cause\">Taking a Pill for Your Headache Will Not Address the Root Cause!<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19923\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Acid-Reflux-Medications-Gastrointestinal-Infections.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19923\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19923\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Acid-Reflux-Medications-Gastrointestinal-Infections.webp\" alt=\"Acid reflux and migraine\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Acid reflux and migraine<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The most common instinct would be to pop a pill for the headache.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, common pain-relief medicines like aspirin and NSAIDs can make your GERD worse.

Low stomach acidity makes the stomach an easy target for colonization by harmful bacteria like <em>H. pylori<\/em>. <em>H. pylori<\/em> growth is known to cause GERD as well as ulcers. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can also cause or worsen an existing, GERD.
