Is it for real? The Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Govt., says <em>\u201cprediabetes means your blood glucose (sugar) levels are higher than normal\u2014but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.\u201d <\/em>Blood glucose (sugar) levels are one the symptoms of prediabetes that people ignore.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What_Is_It\"><span id=\"What_Is_Prediabetes\">What Is Prediabetes?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The American Diabetes Association classifies anyone with fasting blood sugar between 100-126 mg\/DL or the equivalent of HbA1c between 5.7-6.4% as having prediabetes. Those with fasting blood sugar above 126 mg\/DL or HbA1c 6.5% are said to have diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Most of us think \u2013 we\u2019re fine, going about our business, like normal. Then we visit the doc; either just for a regular physical or because we feel we\u2019re using the washroom a lot more than before, so let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s happening. He\/she orders some tests, the results arrive with a red mark against the blood sugar number and boom &#8211; we now have diabetes!<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not quite how it all happens.<\/p>\n<p>Elevated levels of insulin and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/14-amazing-herbs-that-lower-blood-sugar\/\">blood sugar<\/a> cause diabetes damage to you body for years before you\u2019re actually labelled \u201cdiabetic\u201d. That period, often lasting years, is called prediabetes.\u00a0It is like you are \u201con the fence.\u201d Many experts refer to this condition as \u201cborderline diabetes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The mechanism through which elevated sugar and insulin levels harm your body is being better understood each day. The sooner we are able to catch the symptoms, the sooner we can prevent full blown diabetes from harming us.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/prediabetes-risk-test-tool\/\">Take A Prediabetes Risk Test<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Causes_of_Prediabetes\">Causes of Prediabetes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While the exact causes of prediabetes is\u00a0yet unknown, family history and genetics seem to play a role in its development. A sedentary, stressful lifestyle and poor food choices and obesity seem to be the triggers that then \u2018manifest\u2019 or make the genetics play out.<\/p>\n<p>Temporarily elevated blood sugars are a normal phenomenon in our bodies. Blood sugar usually rises after we\u2019ve eaten a meal. But normal glucose metabolism assures that this excess glucose is taken care. Insulin is released from the pancreas in response to high levels of blood glucose. It assists the movement of this glucose from the blood to the inside of cells where glucose is used as fuel for the various cellular activity. Glucose beyond this is stored in the liver first, and after the liver is full, it is stored in the fat cells around the body.<\/p>\n<p>Problems arise when glucose levels stay elevated for a long time. This usually happens when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin or cells become resistant to the action of insulin and do not respond to it the way they normally should.<\/p>\n<p>Prediabetes begins with impairment of glucose metabolism. This leads to elevated blood glucose levels. These levels are high enough to start causing damage to the body but we can\u2019t yet tell, because many of us may not have symptoms. It is often only when the condition progresses to full-blown diabetes that the person gets to know that he or she has diabetes.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/symptoms-prediabetes-women\/\">Prediabetes In Women: Symptoms &amp; Tips To Manage Them<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"PrediabetesRisk_Factors\">Prediabetes\u00a0Risk Factors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Prediabetes is a condition that precedes type 2 diabetes. The same risk factors that increase the risk of developing full-blown type 2 diabetes are also the ones that increase the risk of prediabetes.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being overweight \u2013 The more fatty tissue you have, especially inside muscles and around your abdomen, the more resistant your cells are to the action of insulin.<\/li>\n<li>Dietary habits \u2013 High consumption of refined carbohydrates, sugary foods and eating red and processed meat is linked to development of prediabetes.<\/li>\n<li>Sedentary lifestlyle \u2013 Inactivity is a well-known risk factor for prediabetes. Physical activity helps burn glucose and stops it from getting converted to fat. Vigorous physical activity can also help burn excess fats, especially when combined with lower carb intake.<\/li>\n<li>Age \u2013 While the condition can develop at any age, the majority of cases are seen after the age of 45 when people start losing muscle mass, exercise less, gain weight and have less control over their eating habits.<\/li>\n<li>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-diabetes-type-2\/\">This syndrome<\/a> that is characterized by fertility problems, obesity and hormonal imbalance in women is a risk factor for insulin resistance and eventually prediabetes.<\/li>\n<li>Sleep disorders \u2013 Sleep disorders like sleep apnea are at an increased risk of insulin resistance. Irregular sleep patterns and sleep deprivation can also put a person at risk of prediabetes.<\/li>\n<li>Family history \u2013 If you have a parent or a sibling with type 2 diabetes, it increases your chances of getting prediabetes and eventually, type 2 diabetes.<\/li>\n<li>Gestational diabetes \u2013 Pregnant women have temporarily elevated blood sugar levels. If the levels are higher than what is deemed \u201cnormal,\u201d the woman is said to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/what-is-gestational-diabetes\/\">gestational diabetes<\/a>. While the condition usually resolves by itself, it does put the child, as well as the mother, at high risk of developing prediabetes later.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Other conditions that increase the risk of prediabetes are elevated blood pressure, low levels of HDL or \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides in the blood.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/pre-diabetes-test\/\">Prediabetes Test Measures And Results To Be Sure!<\/a><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"Is_Prediabetes_A_Cause_for_Major_Worry\"><span id=\"Is_Prediabetes_A_Cause_for_Major_Worry\">Is Prediabetes A Cause for Major Worry?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A CDC report in 2014 found that 86 million Americans had prediabetes and if they did not make diet and lifestyle changes, 15-20% of them would end up diabetic within the next 5 years.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18772\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Pre-diabetes-Signs-and-Symptoms.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18772\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18772\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Pre-diabetes-Signs-and-Symptoms.webp\" alt=\"Diet and lifestyle changes helps reversing Pre-diabetes - also see symptoms of prediabetes\" width=\"779\" height=\"453\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18772\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diet and lifestyle changes helps reversing Pre-diabetes &#8211; also see symptoms of prediabetes<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Alarmingly, diabetes is not the only danger awaiting those\u00a0with prediabetes.
