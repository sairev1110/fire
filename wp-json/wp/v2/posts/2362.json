Is there anything it isn\u2019t good for? We all know walking is good for the heart and health. Research has shown that walking has several benefits for our health, including the way it positively influences a particular protein in the endothelium, the inside walls of our arteries. This protein, called Endothelin-1, constricts our blood vessels, reducing blood flow. Vitamin C has been shown to have the same \u201crelaxing\u201d effect on the arteries as walking.<\/p>\n<p>A paper presented at the American Physiological Society&#8217;s 14th International Conference on Endothelin highlighted this when they studied 35 sedentary, overweight adults. They divided them into two groups. One group began to walk regularly while the other began having of 500 mg of Vitamin C daily. Both groups experienced the same benefits of arterial \u201crelaxation\u201d. Two-time Nobel Prize winner Dr. Linus Pauling believed, as a result of his clinical research that Vitamin C, taken in high doses, had the ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/glutathione-antioxidant-cleanser-arteries\/\">reverse arterial hardening<\/a> or atherosclerosis.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out the reason fresh vegetables and fruits are great for our heart is because they are fabulous sources of Vitamin C.

In a study of patients with stable coronary artery disease (heart attack survivors, folks with chest pain, etc.), supplementation with Pycnogenol showed a 32% improvement in endothelial function. In simple language that means that walls of their blood vessels began to function more like they are meant to \u2013 relaxing more and allowing for greater blood flow.<\/p>\n<p>Another remarkable study showed that pycnogenol was able to slow down progression of cardiovascular disease. Plaque formations in the arteries of the leg and neck of 1363 adults were measured as part of the San Valentino cardiology epidemiological study. The plaques narrow blood vessels and reduce blood flow. The groups were then divided into various cohorts that received either different doses of pycnogenol or placebo or aspirin. The group that got 100 mg per day of pycnogenol had the most significant benefits when ultrasonic imaging was repeated over a 30-month period.<\/p>\n<p>Since pycnogenol improves circulation, men who are suffering from cardiac disease can also expect benefits in the erectile dysfunction department<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Be aware, be safe: One of the ways Pycnogenol works is by thinning your blood. If you are on blood thinners or use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/report-shows-heart-healthy-habits-lower-drug-costs\/\">medication for blood pressure control<\/a>, use with care and involve your medical practitioner.

It is an extract from Cuban sugar cane and for that reason, almost all the research that talks about this supplement come from one institute in Cuba. Other labs that have tried to replicate the same effects have reported mixed results. However, if you go by the number of people swearing by it for its effects in lowering LDL and its effects on a condition called intermittent claudication, you simply can\u2019t ignore it. We don\u2019t believe that cholesterol-measurements are the way to go, so we are including it among the lesser know heart helpers for its effects on intermittent claudication.<\/p>\n<p>In plain speak, this is a condition that many heart patients are familiar with \u2013 coldness and pain in arms and legs due to poor circulation. When they walk distances, they feel moderate to severe pain in their legs. They also feel a loss of energy and inability to walk, since poor circulation results in lowered oxygen supply to their legs. In two studies on policosanol involving patients with this problem, supplementation with 10mg, twice a day, for six months showed substantial improvement in distance covered before pain set in. Patients also reported lesser coldness of legs. The follow-up study, over two years, showed that these benefits held and many of the patients were even able to witness increases in wrist and ankle pressure, a relevant improvement in patients with the problem.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Be aware, be safe: One of the major ways Policosanol works is by reducing platelet aggregation \u2013 preventing your blood platelets from sticking to each other. This is what blood thinners like aspirin also do.
