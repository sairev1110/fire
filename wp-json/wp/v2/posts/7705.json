Alternative medicine is gaining momentum and with good reason! The same is true for treatments for diabetes type 2. You have therapies that can reverse diabetes through lifestyle and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/simple-diabetic-diet\/\">diet changes<\/a>, natural supplements that can help stabilize blood sugar levels, and also herbs that lower blood sugar. Not only are these alternative therapies safer, but they are also easier on your pocket, on your body and mind.<\/p>\n<p>Maintaining normal blood sugar levels is necessary for the body&#8217;s overall health. Erratic blood sugar levels can affect the body&#8217;s ability to function normally and even lead to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/type-2-diabetes-complications\/\">complications<\/a> if left unchecked. Some herbs and spices found in nature do a tremendous job of naturally lowering blood sugar levels, making them a boon for diabetics and pre-diabetics. What\u2019s more, being nature\u2019s multi-taskers, herbs and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/fantastic-health-benefits-spices\/\">spices<\/a> also produce overall health benefits beyond just helping balance blood sugar.<\/p>\n<p>We want to clarify one thing right away \u2013 not everything on our list can be classified as \u2018herbs\u2019.

Please note that while we normally do not use animal studies to support any dietary supplement, several herbs like garlic and ginger are considered \u2018food\u2019 and so, are used traditionally by cultures across the world in their daily diet for their additional medical benefits.

Also Gymnema Sylvestre may help rejuvenate beta cells in the pancreas thus helping heal the condition.<\/p>\n<p>Gymnema Sylvestre is a vine native to Central &amp; South India. Used in traditional Indian medicine since the 6th century BC, the leaves of this plant contain \u2018gymnemic acids\u2019 that have the amazing ability to slow down the transport of glucose from the intestines to the bloodstream. Some scientists even believe that Gymnema Sylvestre extract can help repair and regenerate pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin!<\/p>\n<p>There was a clinical trial conducted at Department of Biochemistry, Postgraduate Institute of Basic Medical Sciences Madras, India that studied 22 patients with type 2 diabetes. It reported that supplementing the body with 400 mg of Gymnema Sylvestre extract daily resulted in remarkable reductions in blood glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c and glycosylated plasma protein levels. What\u2019s even more remarkable is that by the end of this 18 month study, participants were able to reduce the dosage of their prescription diabetes medication. Five were even completely off medication and attaining stable blood sugar levels with Gymnema Sylvestre supplementation alone.<\/p>\n<p>Other research conducted at the same institute studied possible regeneration of the islets of langerhans in rats that were made diabetic for the study and then given gymnema sylvestre leaf extracts. The diabetic rats were able to double the number of their islets and beta cell numbers. Researchers felt that the herbal therapy was able to bring blood sugar stability by repairing the pancreas and increasing insulin secretion.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Cinnamon\"><span id=\"Cinnamon\">Cinnamon<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_21131\" style=\"width: 900px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Cinnamon.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21131\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21131\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Cinnamon.webp\" alt=\"Herbs That Lower Blood Sugar\" width=\"890\" height=\"351\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-21131\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cinnamon<\/p><\/div>\n<p>According to studies, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/cinnamon-and-diabetes\/\">cinnamon<\/a> may have a positive effect on the glycemic control and the lipid profile in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.
