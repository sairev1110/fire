Program<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div>\n\n<p>For any woman, menopause is a natural part of aging. With time, the ovaries reduce production of sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone, leading up to menopause. Menopause officially marks the end of female fertility and menstruation, and it should not be considered as an illness or disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a\nnatural biological process, menopause can present itself with some drastic\nchanges in hormonal stability, leading to a variety of symptoms &#8211; ranging from\nmild to severe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, menopause rarely occurs suddenly. As a woman, you can begin noticing these symptoms 8 to 10 years before menopause actually occurs. Most women begin experiencing these symptoms in their 40s, but it is not uncommon these days to start as early as mid-30s. This phase, during which you begin to notice symptoms of menopause, but you still have irregular periods, is termed as perimenopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"A_Word_on_Perimenopause\"><strong>A Word on Perimenopause<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Medically, menopause\nis defined as a time when a woman has not had her menstrual period for at least\n12 consecutive months (or a year). The period before menopause, when you begin\nnoticing signs of hormonal changes, is defined as perimenopause. During this\nphase, the ovaries gradually produce lesser estrogen, and your periods may move\nbecome farther apart from each other. On the other hand, some women may notice\nirregular periods that come closer together and do not follow their previous\npattern of being 25-40 days apart. To put it simply, when you experience\nperimenopause, your periods become difficult to predict. You may also\nexperience heavier or lighter flow, or notice more blood clots during\nperimenopause. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menopause will kick in when your ovaries produce so little estrogen than it no longer leads to the release of a healthy egg from your ovaries, to trigger menstruation after 14-16 days. Remember, if your last period was less than a year ago, you are not fully menopausal yet, &nbsp;and could still become pregnant. We discuss the various symptoms of perimenopause in a different article, so give that a read too. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"The_Complete_List_Of_35_Symptoms_Of_Menopause\"><strong>The Complete List Of 35 Symptoms Of Menopause<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Symptoms-of-Menopause.webp\" alt=\"Symptoms-of-Menopause\" class=\"wp-image-19150\"\/><figcaption>Symptoms-of-Menopause<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some symptoms of\nmenopause can occur years before a woman experiences her last period, while\nothers can last for years afterwards as well. Since hormones vary from one\nwoman to another, menopause affects all women differently. Some may experience\nvery few symptoms while others could experience most of them. Symptoms can also\nvary in frequency and severity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are these symptoms that signal menopause is upon you? Let\u2019s talk about all the 35 symptoms of menopause to look out for. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Irregular_Periods\"><strong>Irregular Periods<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/womens-health\/dealing-with-the-symptoms-of-menopause\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Irregularities in your menstrual cycle<\/a> can happen any time through life for a bunch of different reasons. However, if you are in your 40s and notice irregularities in the pattern of your usual menstrual cycle, this could be one of the first signs of menopause. The reason is the declining levels of estrogen and progesterone in the body, which can cause your periods to become more frequent or more spaced out, and also present itself as changes in period flow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Hot_Flashes\"><strong>Hot Flashes<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common symptoms of menopause, a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nia.nih.gov\/health\/what-are-signs-and-symptoms-menopause\" target=\"_blank\">hot flash<\/a> causes a sudden feeling of intense heat, resulting in sweating or chills. It can create flushing or redness of the face and neck and make you feel uncomfortably hot, which is not always related to external factors and temperature. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/menopause\/menopause-hot-flashes-causes-natural-treatment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"If you want to read about why they happen and how you can tackle them. (opens in a new tab)\">If you want to read about why they happen and how you can tackle them.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Night_Sweats\"><strong>Night Sweats<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are your hot flashes\nmore frequent during the night? If you wake up sweating profusely and feeling\nextremely hot in the middle of the night, these hot flashes are called night\nsweats. They can interfere with your sleeping pattern, adding to stress and\nfatigue during daytime. Caused by the same hormonal imbalance, night sweats can\nbe improved by wearing airy cotton pyjamas and changing bed linen to cotton.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Fatigue\"><strong>Fatigue<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"176\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/PCOS-and-fatigue-365x176-1.webp\" alt=\"Fatigue\" class=\"wp-image-19153\"\/><figcaption>Fatigue<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling sluggish and\ntired all the time? If you feel fatigued despite spending 8 hours in bed every\nnight, this could be another symptom of menopause. Menopause-related fatigue\ncan affect productivity, sleep quality and mood, increasing your stress levels.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Lapses_in_Memory\"><strong>Lapses in Memory<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you notice\nyourself becoming more forgetful, this could be another temporary sign of\nmenopause. Diminishing levels of estrogen and progesterone can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urmc.rochester.edu\/news\/story\/3436\/brain-fog-of-menopause-confirmed.aspx\">result in memory loss<\/a> as well as foggy thinking. Also, the additional fatigue brought on by\nmenopause doesn\u2019t help! Most women find that their memory improves as they\ntransition completely into menopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Inability_to_Focus\"><strong>Inability to Focus<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with memory\nlapses, fluctuating hormone levels can also cause difficulty in concentrating\nor focusing during menopause. You will likely notice these symptoms during the\nearly phases of perimenopause. However, poor sleep and mood swings can also be\ncontributing factors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Vaginal_Dryness\"><strong>Vaginal Dryness<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The natural <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3197715\/\">decline in estrogen levels during menopause<\/a> can make vaginal tissue become dryer and thinner.\nThis vaginal dryness the tissue becomes more easily irritated and more susceptible\nto infections as well. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Loss_of_Libido\"><strong>Loss of Libido<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing hormone\nlevels can decrease sex drive. For some women, this can be caused by vaginal\ndryness, as sex becomes painful. However, the primary reason behind low libido\nis declining levels of sex hormones. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Urinary_Tract_Infections_UTIs\"><strong>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/conditions\/menopause\/symptoms\/\">Frequent UTIs<\/a> are another\nsign of menopause. As vaginal tissue becomes dryer and thinner, it becomes more\nsusceptible to bacterial infections. Weakening of vaginal walls with waning\nlevels of estrogen allows bacteria easier access to the bladder, leading to\nurinary tract infections that could affect the bladder. The ureters and kidney\ntoo can be affected at times. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Urinary_Incontinence\"><strong>Urinary Incontinence<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Falling levels of\nestrogen during menopause can cause thinning of the urethra and urinary\nbladder. You may notice you have to use the bathroom more frequently. Sometimes,\nweakened pelvic muscles can also cause urinary leakage when you laugh, sneeze,\ncough, lift something heavy, or during rigorous activity. Menopause can also\ncause overflow incontinence wherein you might lose sensation of a full bladder,\nleading to accidental urination. Regular exercises, particularly Kegel\nexercises, can help strengthen pelvic muscles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Bloating\"><strong>Bloating<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"187\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Bloating-365x187-1.webp\" alt=\"Bloating\" class=\"wp-image-19154\"\/><figcaption>Bloating<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Noticing more\nbloating? As estrogen levels fluctuate throughout perimenopause, this may lead\nto water retention. When tissues hold on to water, it causes bloating that\ncomes with a feeling of fullness, heaviness and tightness around the belly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Thinning_of_Hair\"><strong>Thinning of Hair<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"187\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Thinning-of-Hair.webp\" alt=\"Thinning of Hair\" class=\"wp-image-19155\"\/><figcaption>Thinning of Hair<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Low levels of\nestrogen can cause more hair to fall and also lead to thinning of hair. Healthy\nhair follicles need estrogen for growth. So when levels of estrogen start to\ndeteriorate, your hair tends to become dryer, brittle and susceptible to\nbreakage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Brittle_Nails\"><strong>Brittle Nails<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"187\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Brittle-Nails.webp\" alt=\"Brittle Nails\" class=\"wp-image-19156\"\/><figcaption>Brittle Nails<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Estrogen is vital not\njust for the health of your hair but also nails. Low levels can cause brittle\nnails as they become weaker and dryer. It is best to keep your nails short and\nuse a hand cream regularly. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Sleep_Disturbances\"><strong>Sleep Disturbances<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"176\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Sleep-Disturbances.webp\" alt=\"Sleep Disturbances\" class=\"wp-image-19157\"\/><figcaption>Sleep Disturbances<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Many women\nexperiencing menopause report sleep-related disturbances as a symptom. This\ncould be night sweats, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing or a sense of\nanxiety, all of which disrupt a healthy sleep pattern. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Dizzy_Spells\"><strong>Dizzy Spells<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluctuating hormone\nlevels can also cause dizziness. These spells come suddenly and could pass in a\nfew minutes or even become extended. If you are feeling more dizzy than usual,\nbe aware of the risk of falling or accidents when driving or operating\nmachinery. Avoid bending down or rising suddenly, since this period of life is\nassociated with orthostatic hypotension or low blood pressure caused by sudden\nchanges in posture. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Mood_Swings\"><strong>Mood Swings<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As with PMS,\nmenopause comes with its own set of mood swings. Fluctuating levels of sex\nhormones affect neurotransmitters in the brain \u2013 like serotonin and GABA,\nmaking you more irritable. Your mood swings could become more frequent as\nhormones are out of balance, adding to your stress levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Panic_Disorder\"><strong>Panic Disorder<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For some women,\nimbalances in hormones during menopause can manifest as panic disorder as well.\nYou may notice debilitating emotional episodes that come out of nowhere,\naccompanied by rapid heartbeat, irrational feelings of dread, anger and\nsadness, extreme terror and shallow breathing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Anxiety\"><strong>Anxiety<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dopamine and\nserotonin are neurotransmitters that play a crucial role in regulating mood. A\ndecline in estrogen levels during menopause can interfere with the production\nof these neurotransmitters, which can lead to anxiety. If you notice you can\u2019t\nseem to relax or find calm, it\u2019s best to talk to your medical professional. You\ncan also add deep breathing exercises to your daily regimen, as it is one of\nthe most researched interventions to help with menopausal symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Depression\"><strong>Depression<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"187\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Depression.webp\" alt=\"Depression\" class=\"wp-image-19158\"\/><figcaption>Depression<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As progesterone and\nestrogen levels fall during menopause, these hormonal changes bring with them a\nmyriad of unpleasant side effects, which can negatively impact quality of life\nfor some women. Add to that anxiety, mood swings, sleep disturbances and\nfatigue. This makes many menopausal women more susceptible to depression.\nTherapy and alternative treatments can help improve quality of life, treating\ndepression in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Insomnia\"><strong>Insomnia<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Menopause related\ninsomnia is usually a direct effect of hot flashes, night sweats, panic\ndisorder or anxiety. However, low levels of progesterone can also contribute to\npoor sleep, even when you don\u2019t experience night sweats or anxiety. Many\nmenopausal women report an inability to fall asleep after retiring to bed or\nwaking up at 3 or 4 am in the morning and then being unable to go back to\nsleep. These disturbances are caused by the way that falling oestrogen and\nprogesterone affect the hormone adrenaline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Weight_Gain\"><strong>Weight Gain<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"176\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Weight-Gain.webp\" alt=\"Weight Gain\" class=\"wp-image-19159\"\/><figcaption>Weight Gain<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your favourite\npair of pants suddenly too tight? Menopause related weight gain can come on\nsuddenly and surprise many women. Hormonal imbalances can lead to unexplained\nweight gain as well as loss of muscle mass. Many women notice this weight gain\naround the belly. This is why a healthy diet and regular exercise plan are very\nimportant for menopausal women. Researchers have found that eating the right\ndiet and getting the right amount of moderate exercise seems to help this\nproblem <em>better than<\/em> crash dieting and intensive exercise that many women\nresort to, at this age. The sudden weight gain often scares women into going\noverboard, especially on exercise, and this can worsen the situation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Frequent_Headaches\"><strong>Frequent Headaches<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many menopausal women\nexperience frequent headaches, which are linked to waning levels of estrogen.\nThese headaches might be mild to begin with, but can become more intense as\nhormone levels continue to drop with advancing menopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Sensation_of_a_Burning_Tongue\"><strong>Sensation of a Burning Tongue<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluctuations in\nestrogen levels can cause a sensation of burning in the tongue, gums, lips or\ninner cheek. You may also notice pain or a metallic taste in the mouth\nthroughout menopause. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Digestive_Issues\"><strong>Digestive Issues<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Estrogen and cortisol\nlevels go hand in hand. Lower estrogen lowers the buffer against the stress\nhormones of cortisol and adrenaline. Higher levels of cortisol in the blood\nsignal to the brain that you are in danger, leading to non-essential functions\nlike digestion being temporarily stopped, upsetting your digestive routine. You\ncould experience abdominal pain or discomfort, constipation, bloating and other\ndigestive problems while your hormones are out of balance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Muscle_Tightness\"><strong>Muscle Tightness<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Menopause can also be\nthe reason behind muscle tension. Changing hormone levels can cause muscles in\nthe back, neck and shoulders to tighten or strain. You may also experience\nmuscle stiffness, soreness and aches throughout your body. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Joint_Pain\"><strong>Joint Pain<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Declining estrogen\nlevels during menopause can contribute to joint pain. It is known to most women\nthat menopause can lead to weaker bones due to declining bone density. This is\noften due to lower levels of oestrogen. The lowered bone mass and density when\ncombined with muscle tightness and increased inflammation, can lead to serious\njoint pains. Many menopausal women complain of tightness in hips, soreness in\nknees, and joint swelling or fingers and toes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Allergies\"><strong>Allergies<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly find\nyourself sniffling in the allergy season? Hormonal fluctuations can weaken your\nimmune system, making you more prone to seasonal allergies. From sinus\ninfections to rashes, itchy eyes, swelling and sneezing, menopause can\nexacerbate allergy symptoms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Body_Odour_Changes\"><strong>Body Odour Changes<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you experience\nfrequent hot flashes, chances are that you\u2019ve noticed changes in your body\nodour. Menopause can affect a woman\u2019s natural scent. Excessive sweating can\nlead to bad body odour, making good personal hygiene extremely important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Itchiness\"><strong>Itchiness<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With age and changing\nhormone levels, collagen production slows down. As collagen is crucial for\nmaintaining moisture and elasticity in skin, menopausal women may experience\nmore skin dryness, irritation and itchiness. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Osteoporosis\"><strong>Osteoporosis<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Estrogen is vital for\nnot only your sexual health but also for maintaining bone density. Estrogen is\ncrucial for preventing bone resorption, and waning levels throughout\nperimenopause can accelerate bone loss. Many menopausal and post-menopausal\nwomen are at high risk for osteoporosis, which is characterised by decrease in\nbone mass and density, as well as weakening of bones.&nbsp; This is why eating a balanced calcium-rich\ndiet and engaging in moderate intensity weight-bearing exercises is so\nimportant to retain bone density as you transition into menopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Irregular_Heartbeat\"><strong>Irregular Heartbeat<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Falling estrogen\nlevels can sometimes overstimulate the circulatory and nervous systems. This\nmay cause irregular heartbeat, heart palpitations and\/or arrhythmia. If you\nexperience these symptoms, report them to your doctor immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Breast_Pain\"><strong>Breast Pain<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Did your breasts\noften feel sore around your periods? Fluctuating hormone levels can cause\nbreast tenderness and soreness, and these same fluctuations can also cause\nbreast pain during menopause. You may experience pain or soreness that is\nunpredictable and unrelated to menstrual cycle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Changes_in_Breast_Tissue\"><strong>Changes in Breast Tissue<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluctuating hormone\nlevels can also cause changes to your breast size and shape. As estrogen levels\ndrop and your breast milk system begins to shut down, changes occur in\nglandular tissues of the breast. Your breasts may shrink or change in size and\nshape.
