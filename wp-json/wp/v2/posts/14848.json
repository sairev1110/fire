A low carb diet for PCOS helps in addressing the root cause of this health condition. Let&#8217;s understand how.<\/p>\n<p>Too much blood sugar leads to too much insulin. Too much insulin leads to too much testosterone, which in turn pushes the female hormone estrogen out of balance.<\/p>\n<p>The result: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-irregular-periods\/\">irregular periods<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-acne\/\">acne<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-hair-loss\/\">hair fall<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-hirsutism\/\">excess body hair<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-pregnancy\/\">inability to conceive<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-weight-gain-master-guide\/\">weight gain<\/a> and much, much more.<\/p>\n<p>Your blood sugar levels don\u2019t have to show full-blown <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-connection-diabetes\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">diabetes<\/a> for this to happen. The damage begins far earlier, in many subtle ways.<\/p>\n<p>When you start a diet that removes most simple carbs from your diet, it is the sugars that you are primarily removing. Quick recap: Remember, when we say \u201csugar\u201d, it is not just the white crystal-like stuff alone. It is all the <em>maida<\/em>, the white rice, the bread, the pasta, the Maggi, the potatoes, the chips\u2026you get the idea<\/p>\n<p>When you are on a diet that reduces carbs, you are telling your body that it will no longer get sugar as an easy source of fuel. So, it has to switch fuels and use complex carbohydrates (like vegetables) and fats (like butter, ghee, etc.) to fuel itself. What\u2019s even more important, you are telling it to burn the stored fat \u2013 the stuff around your waist, your hips, your buttocks, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This switch is not easy. The body protests. It gives you cleansing symptoms. This is a crucial time. By not giving in to cravings for simple carbs \u2013 like the <em>dosa<\/em> or the rice or <em>samosa<\/em> or the white toast \u2013 you are forming a fantastic new habit. If you give in, the body thinks \u201cI will continue to get simple sugars. Why should I burn her fat?\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>So, don\u2019t kid yourself into thinking that one <em>masala dosa<\/em> today, two vadas<em>\u00a0<\/em>tomorrow\u00a0and one stuffed <em>kulcha<\/em> on the third day can\u2019t really \u201cadd up\u201d. It does. Instead, discuss your indulgence or \u201ccheat\u201d with a nutritionist. Enjoy that thoroughly, but limit yourself to that.<\/p>\n<p>When you opt for a low-carb diet for PCOS, you\u2019re teaching your body a wonderful new way to create energy and burn fat \u2013 something that will bring you a lifetime of health. So stick with it, it\u2019s well worth it. Wish you vibrant health and wellbeing.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
