Sugar cravings can often get out of hand, and it is important to know how to stop them. Let&#8217;s find out 4 dietary supplements to stop sugar cravings.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Magnesium\">Magnesium<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/magnesium-and-diabetes-type-2\/\">Magnesium<\/a> plays an important role in lowering insulin<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>resistance. In a study conducted\u00a0in Newfoundland, it was found that a higher intake of magnesium\u00a0is strongly linked with reduced insulin resistance. Thus, it is very beneficial for overweight and obese individuals.<\/p>\n<p>When the body experiences low levels of magnesium, we crave for chocolates.\u00a0The magnesium-rich cocoa in chocolates satisfies our cravings. But there are several other healthier sources of magnesium. These include seeds, nuts, beans, fish and leafy green vegetables.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chromium_Picolinate\">Chromium Picolinate<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While the human body does not require lots of\u00a0chromium,\u00a0it is essential for the slow release of sugar in the body. Supplementing with chromium helps in normalizing blood sugar levels. It also helps in improving blood sugar utilizations. In a pilot research, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16184071\">113 patients were given 600 <\/a>mug of chromium picolinate. It was seen that chromium helped in suppressing carbohydrate and sugar cravings and normalizing appetites. Another study mentions that chromium picolinate also helps in reducing weight gain.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Gymnema_Sylvestre\">Gymnema Sylvestre<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/gymnema-sylvestre-diabetes\/\">Gymnema Sylvestre<\/a>\u00a0is known as a sugar destroyer in Ayurveda. The chemical compounds in this herb help in curbing sugar cravings. A study was conducted on 22 patients who were given this herb. The patients showed a\u00a0significant reduction in blood sugar. In fact, five of those patients were able to discontinue their regular drug they were using for controlling blood sugar. This also helps in weight loss, controlling blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cinnamon\">Cinnamon<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Research indicates that chromium and the chemicals in cinnamon improve fasting blood sugar. Cinnamon also increases lean body mass in the human body. Another study carried out by the American Diabetic Association shows that regular intake of cinnamon lowers blood glucose levels in the body. Since\u00a0cinnamon effectively controls\u00a0blood glucose levels in the body, it also helps in lowering the sugar cravings. Yeast and gut bacteria are some other causes of sugar cravings. Cinnamon is known for its anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity. And this makes it an effective supplement to curb these cravings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Magnesium2 Chromium Picolinate3 Gymnema Sylvestre4 Cinnamon Do you have sugar cravings and then feel guilty about overindulging in sugar?
