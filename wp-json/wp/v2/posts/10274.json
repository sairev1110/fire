Most people don\u2019t realize that our behavior and psychology can influence our eating habits. Emotional changes may increase or decrease our food intake and could also lead to lifestyle changes.<\/p>\n<h2>The Psychology of Eating<\/h2>\n<p>Even though hunger is the main driving force behind eating, other factors may drive us to overeat\u00a0unconsciously. For example, insecurities, being upset or being angry can lead us to eat more than usual. These factors are not related to hunger, but can still cause compulsive eating.<\/p>\n<p>Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is a psychological disorder that is common in obese individuals. But, keep in mind that every person with this disorder may not be obese. Some people\u00a0with BED may consume excessive calories, and then, use harmful methods to counteract the weight gain. One such harmful method\u00a0is inducing vomiting after an episode of overeating.<\/p>\n<p>Compulsive or binge eating may also be common in patients with mood disorders. Eating as a result of a change in emotions can be harmful, both for the body and the mind. An example of a feel-good food is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/quit-your-sweet-addiction\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">sugar, which can become an addiction<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Being Happy and Relaxed is Good for Digestion<\/h2>\n<p>Despite following the right kind of diet regime, many people don\u2019t witness any changes in their body. This could be because they are unable to cope up with \u00a0their emotions. Our thoughts, feelings, stress and pleasure levels have a major impact on our metabolism. Emotional changes like these can lead to changes in the secretion of hormones, which can change our body\u2019s capacity to burn calories and break down food.\u00a0Stress and anxiety can disrupt the functioning of our digestive systems.<\/p>\n<p>Food that is not properly digested can result in harmful cholesterol and unwanted fat deposits in the body. This is one reason why many people don\u2019t experience weight loss even after \u00a0following a proper diet.\u00a0Being happy and relaxed has a direct impact on the proper functioning of our body systems.<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, eating in a peaceful environment and in a calm state of mind results in slower eating and faster metabolism. Being happy also stops compulsive and binge eating. This way, you are satisfied with whatever food they consume and don\u2019t need to eat more to feel better.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most people don\u2019t realize that our behavior and psychology can influence our eating habits.
