This makes it acidic, with a potential of Hydrogen (pH) ranging from 4 to 5. A pH scale of less than 7 is acidic. Whereas milk is non-acidic, with a pH of about 7.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, the acidity level of a food does not determine whether it is an \u2018acid-forming food\u2019 or not. Yogurt, though acidic in nature, is a low acid-forming food, because it does not affect the acid-alkaline balance of the body.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Yogurt_has_Probiotics_Good_Bacteria\">Yogurt has Probiotics (Good Bacteria)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Bad bacteria in the digestive tract are one of the causes of acid reflux. Probiotics are microorganisms (certain bacteria and yeasts) that are good for the body. These probiotics or \u2018good bacteria\u2019 prevent the bad bacteria from growing rapidly.\u00a0Probiotics also help in reducing inflammation of the stomach caused by acid reflux.<\/p>\n<div class=\"col-md-12 arti-subsc\">\n<div class=\"subscriberow\">[mc4wp_form id=&#8221;12950&#8243;]<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Yogurt_is_Easier_to_Digest\">Yogurt is Easier to Digest<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The bacteria in it release an enzyme in the stomach that makes it easier to break down lactose. Because of its sugar content, lactose is hard to digest.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Milk_can_Aggravate_Acid_Reflux\">Milk can Aggravate Acid Reflux<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In a study conducted by <em>Gut and Liver<\/em>, an international journal of gastroenterology, it was found that cow\u2019s milk aggravated acid reflux among participants. They also found that medication for GERD was ineffective because of milk in the diet. When it was removed from the diet of the participants, their condition improved.<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, although milk has numerous health benefits, it&#8217;s one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/ten-foods-avoid-acid-reflux\/\">foods to avoid for acid reflux.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 What&#8217;s the Difference Between the Two?2 Yogurt has Probiotics (Good Bacteria)3 Yogurt is Easier to Digest4 Milk can Aggravate Acid Reflux While both are dairy products, yogurt and milk have different effects on acid reflux.
