This is a condition when a man is unable to sustain an erection necessary for sexual intercourse. It\u2019s obviously embarrassing and can take a huge mental toll, but beyond this, <strong>erectile dysfunction can also be among the first signs of impending coronary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/congestive-heart-failure\/\">heart disease<\/a>.<\/strong> This is because both involve troubles with blood circulation. A lot of research has been done on how to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) and the dietary supplement Pine Bark Extract (PBE) had shown a lot of promise. Since ED is often connected to a future heart condition, PBE can help reduce cardiac risk too. It is indeed amazing when one examines pine bark extract benefits.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Pine_Bark_Extract_How_Does_It_Work\">Pine Bark Extract: How Does It Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The endothelium is a thin layer of cells in the arteries, responsible for regulation of blood flow to the various organs in the body. For a variety of reasons, from poor diet, to uncontrolled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/asthma\/4-tips-reduce-stress-related-asthma-attacks\/\">stress<\/a>, to lack of the right nutrients, this endothelium may not function properly. What this means is that if your blood vessels don\u2019t relax fully, blood cannot flow to the penis to make it hard during sexual arousal.<\/p>\n<p>Inflammation or repair of damages caused to the body due to various factors \u2013 poor diet, excessive stress and so on &#8211; is the second most common cause of erectile dysfunction. <strong>Pine bark extract has shown promise to help relax blood vessels and counter inflammatory damage to them. \u00a0\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Pine bark extract contains strong antioxidants which promote the formation of nitrogen in the endothelium. Nitric oxide relaxes the blood vessels, increasing blood flow to them. It also has anti-inflammatory properties which reduce inflammation and support proper erectile function.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Pine_Bark_Extract_Benefits_For_Erectile_Dysfunction_How_Much_And_For_How_Long\">Pine Bark Extract Benefits For Erectile Dysfunction: How Much And For How Long?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A study was conducted at a fertility clinic in Sofia, Bulgaria, for three months on forty men, between 25 to 45 years of age. In the first month, the men were given 1700 mg of L-arginine daily. In the second month, 80 mg of pine bark extract was added to this daily dose. In the third month, an additional 40 mg of pine bark extract was added. The results at the end of 3 months were quite interesting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>80% of men in the study could regain their normal erection after 2 months of treatment and 92.5% of men confirmed this after 3 months.<\/strong> There were no reported side effects in any of the participants.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Pine_Bark_For_Prostate_Cancer_And_Infertility\">Pine Bark For Prostate Cancer And Infertility<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18675\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Nov-4-copy-7544.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18675\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Nov-4-copy-7544.webp\" alt=\"Pine Bark For Prostate Cancer And Infertility\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18675\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pine Bark For Prostate Cancer And Infertility<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Research on pine bark extract shows that it possesses key phytochemical constituents like flavonoids, proanthocyanidins and proanthocyanidins.

Although pine bark extract can rejuvenate sexual health by treating the physical cause for erectile dysfunction, it is very important to get the basics right. Eating fresh fruits and green salads, having disciplined sleeping habits and exercising well can help release stress and improve sexual health. Reduction in alcohol intake and smoking can also help.<\/p>\n<p>Studies have also shown that over-exposure to pornography escalates the problem of erectile dysfunction. Sustained abstinence from such viewing material over a long period of time can help counter the negative effects of internet pornography and subsequently improve sexual health.<\/p>\n<p>So keep these points in mind and if you need a dependable multi-faceted helper for your circulation and overall health, use pine bark extract.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 At The Heart Of Erectile Dysfunction (ED)2 Pine Bark Extract: How Does It Work?3 Pine Bark Extract Benefits For Erectile Dysfunction: How Much And For How Long?4 Pine Bark For Prostate Cancer And Infertility5 Pine Bark For Better Circulation, Heart Health and Brain Function6 Things to Look Out For When Using Pine [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":18677,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[69],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -
