The good bacteria help produce nitrates from food, which open blood vessels and reduce blood pressure.\u00a0 If you like the strong mouthwashes, they may have a little magic ingredient called chlorhexidine, which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/health\/article-2546092\/Mouthwashes-raise-risk-heart-attack-strokes-Antiseptic-gargles-kill-good-bacteria-help-blood-pressure-down.html\">raises your blood pressure<\/a> even when used for a day!

When you have a root canal done, since you get all your nerves in the area taken out, your immune system no longer knows what\u2019s going on there. Anaerobic bacteria have been found to grow there, unchecked. They then travel through the blood to damage your blood vessels and cause <a href=\"http:\/\/articles.mercola.com\/sites\/articles\/archive\/2015\/05\/31\/root-canal-teeth.aspx\">blood clots<\/a>.
