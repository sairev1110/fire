With period cramps, stagnation is thought to lodge in the lower abdomen and become irritated or activated when the body tries to start shedding tissue.<\/p>\n<p>You may wonder why you have to suffer through period cramps in the first place. The explanation lies in the fact that your uterus must shed its natural lining each month\u2013a job that requires your uterine muscle to contract. As it contracts, blood vessels that supply blood to the uterus become constricted, which reduces blood flow and results in pain. For some women, the hormonal changes that trigger periods may be more pronounced, causing the uterus to contract overzealously\u2013and more painfully.<\/p>\n<p>But every problem has a solution, even better a natural solution. And this case, there are way too many to ease things out a bit. Let&#8217;s have a look at the 8 best and easiest ones &#8211;<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Magnesium\">Magnesium<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_21227\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Magnesium.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21227\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21227\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Magnesium.webp\" alt=\"period pain\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-21227\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Magnesium<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Magnesium\u00a0is a calming mineral and can assist your body throughout your cycle. It is thought to relieve cramping in many different ways, such as by helping relax muscles and increasing the absorption of calcium.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, increasing your\u00a0magnesium\u00a0intake can help alleviate\u00a0PMS\u00a0symptoms such as bloating, dizziness, headaches and sugar cravings. The University of Maryland Medical Center recommends supplementing about 360 milligrams, once daily, for three days. You&#8217;ll get better results, if begun one or two days before bleeding starts.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Vitamin_D3\">Vitamin D3<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_21229\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Vitamin-D3.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21229\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21229\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Vitamin-D3.webp\" alt=\"period pain\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-21229\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vitamin D3<\/p><\/div>\n<p>According to an Italian study, 40 women with low D3 levels (18ng\/ml)% were administered a single oral dose of 300,000 IU vitamin D3. (which is a very high dose, far exceeding the weekly limit of 50,000 IU), 5 days prior to the anticipated start of their periods. After two months, their average pain levels decreased by 41 percent.<\/p>\n<p>The results are logical because vitamin D3\u2019s anti-inflammatory functions combined with the fact that the uterine lining contains vitamin D receptors suggest vitamin D3\u2019s potential use to treat period pains.<\/p>\n<p>Note: An intake of such a high single dose is always questionable especially if your vitamin D3 levels are normal (50-80 ng\/ml). So, before you try this, do check with your doctor and get your levels tested to see if it&#8217;s safe for you.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Vitamin_B1\">Vitamin B1<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Thiamine (B1) is responsible for fighting mood swings and cramping. When hormones fluctuate in the body, vitamin B1 levels fall and women develop mood problems and experience more pain associated with cramping.<\/p>\n<p>It is recommended that people get 1.4 milligrams of vitamin B1 daily. But by increasing its levels to 50 to 100 milligrams per day, these PMS symptoms can be avoided. According to a Study, women who received 100 milligrams per day of vitamin B1 experienced far lower levels of pain, a more stable mood and were able to deal with stress better.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Omega_3_Oils\">Omega 3 Oils<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_21230\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Omega-3-Oils.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21230\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21230\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Omega-3-Oils.webp\" alt=\"period pain\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-21230\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Omega 3 Oils<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Omega-3 oils, such as fish oil or flax oil, are another natural ally for battling menstrual or period pain. Some studies have shown that fish oil is effective in reducing period pain, especially when combined with vitamin B12.<\/p>\n<p>However, make sure to buy a mercury-free brand of fish oil, and definitely check with your doctor in case you are already taking a blood thinner or daily aspirin, since fish oil has anticoagulant properties.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Herbal_teas\">Herbal teas<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_21241\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Herbal-Teas.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-21241\" class=\"size-full wp-image-21241\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Herbal-Teas.webp\" alt=\"period pain\" width=\"600\" height=\"323\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-21241\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Herbal teas<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Chamomile, fennel, ginger, and red raspberry leaf are delicious herbal teas that specifically support menstruation and ease period cramps.\u00a0Drink three cups a day of these warming teas to help you feel better.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a link to some of them &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>Ginger tea ( https:\/\/youtu.be\/cQvHjlYSteo )<\/p>\n<p>Chamomile( https:\/\/youtu.be\/p4eJRxTDtEA)<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Castor_oil_pack\">Castor oil pack<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Castor oil packs are effective for relieving all kinds of physical pain, detoxing organs and addressing fibroids, among its many uses.\u00a0But it&#8217;s extremely effective when it comes to menstrual or period pain.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re having your menstrual or period flow, and you\u2019re getting cramps, just apply it over the lower abdomen and relax. But since it helps to ease obstructions in the channels, you may experience a slightly heavier flow\u00a0after using it.
