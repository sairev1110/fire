It&#8217;s a good day to remind ourselves to take good care of our the organ that works round the clock to keep us ticking &#8211; our heart. A hundred years ago, we were more likely to die from an infectious disease than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/heart-attacks-happen\/\">heart problems<\/a>. Today however, the reverse is true, and heart disease, a mostly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/congestive-heart-failure\/\">preventable condition<\/a>, is the now the number one killer in the US.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_Is_A_Preventable_Disease_The_Number_One_Killer\">Why Is A Preventable Disease The Number One Killer?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In order to answer this question, we need to look at what has changed in this time.\u00a0 Medical knowledge to combat infection has improved, yes; but more significantly, the American diet and lifestyle habits have taken a turn for the worse.<\/p>\n<p>We<strong> move less and eat more refined food and animal products that we did at any time in our evolution as a species.<\/strong> But why does this matter? Risk factors that contribute to heart disease include obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation &#8211; all of which are heavily influenced by diet and lifestyle factors.<\/p>\n<p>Diets high in sugar, processed grains and animal products and low in plant foods promote inflammation in our body, which in turn leads to damaged tissues and blood vessels.\u00a0 In response to this damage, plaques form over the damaged areas of arteries eventually leading to blockages and threatening the viability of the heart.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Plant_Based_Diets_And_Heart_Disease_The_Science\">Plant Based Diets And Heart Disease: The Science<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Several large studies, including Dr. Campbell\u2019s 2006 China Study, have asked this question and research results have indicated positively, that <strong>a plant-based diet, which restricts or ideally eliminates all animal-based foods, is protective against heart disease.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The studies suggest that a plant-based diet helps clean out blockages in the arteries, helps with repair to the artery wall, raises HDL (or good) cholesterol, and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/herbs-lower-blood-pressure\/\"> reduces blood pressure<\/a> oxidation and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/fight-off-chronic-inflammation-naturally\/\">inflammation <\/a>\u2013 all of which are beneficial in preventing heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Campbell questions whether animal-based foods are a common cause of heart disease and other ailments.\u00a0 While he and other studies have found a positive correlation between a vegetarian\/vegan diet and reduced incidence of heart disease, we also have to be mindful to look at other factors that might influence this change; namely that a properly planned vegetarian or vegan diet is also a \u201cwhole-foods\u201d diet that eliminates all harmful processed foods and is high in beneficial nutrients and fibre, plus lifestyle factors such as exercise.<\/p>\n<p>So, is it the lack of animal protein, other factors, or both, that proposes a vegetarian\/vegan diet is protective against heart disease?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_About_Animal-Based_Foods_And_Heart_Health\">What About Animal-Based Foods And Heart Health?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When analyzing a vegetarian or vegan diet in regard to heart health it is important to decide whether it is the avoidance of animal-based foods or the avoidance of processed foods that provide the greater (or combined) positive effect.<\/p>\n<p>There is no doubt, that a \u201cwell-planned\u201d plant based (zero processed food) diet is anti-inflammatory, alkalizing, high in fibre and nutrients and because of this, beneficial to our heart, blood vessels and circulation.<\/p>\n<p>However, a diet low in protein is not beneficial to heart health.\u00a0 <strong>If you cannot manage to include enough good-quality plant protein in your diet then a small amount from a free-range or wild caught animal source is actually beneficial.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you choose your protein source carefully, such as small amounts of free-range eggs and poultry, wild-caught fish and other organic sources of animal protein this can be beneficial in promoting overall health.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, to counter the acidifying and inflammatory nature of animal-based proteins, ensure you consume a high level of plant-based foods and healthy fats (and again \u2013 zero processed foods).<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"6_Beneficial_Dietary_Changes_For_Heart_Health\">6 Beneficial Dietary Changes For Heart Health<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Eliminate_ALL_Refined_Sugars\">Eliminate ALL Refined Sugars<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>These heavily processed components of packaged foods lead to inflammation and toxic build up in the arteries, insulin resistance, and fatty liver and are strongly linked to diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>Eliminate ALL R<u>efined<\/u>\u00a0Grains (especially wheat)<\/p>\n<p>Refined grains, have most of their nutrients stripped away and break down quickly into sugar, leading to spikes in blood sugar,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insulin Resistance<\/li>\n<li>Oxidative Stress,<\/li>\n<li>Inflammation and<\/li>\n<li>Weight gain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note this group encompasses foods such as white bread, pasta and white rice too.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Eliminate_Harmful_Fats\">Eliminate \u201cHarmful Fats\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Trans Fats and Processed Vegetable Oils found in processed and fast foods \u2013 these chemically altered processed fats increase inflammation and oxidative stress which can promote atherosclerotic plaques in arteries<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Include_Healthy_Fats\">Include Healthy Fats<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Healthy fats from nuts, seeds, avocado, fish, olives etc. \u2013 these fats promote cellular health, healthy blood, blood vessels and circulation and reduce inflammation.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Include_Vegetables_And_Other_Plant-Based_Foods_At_EVERY_Meal_And_Snack\">Include Vegetables And Other Plant-Based Foods At EVERY Meal And Snack<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Plant-based foods including vegetables, fruits, beans, lentils, whole grains, nuts and seeds deliver healthy nutrients and fibre and contribute little in the way of calories. This means they are alkalizing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and help promote detoxification, healthy circulation and weight loss.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Include_Moderate_Amounts_Of_Protein-Based_Foods\">Include Moderate Amounts Of Protein-Based Foods<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Proteins are to our body as bricks are to a house, providing a great deal of the building blocks for muscles, organs and other tissues, including the heart muscle and blood vessels.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18636\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/sept-022-copy-2nd-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18636\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18636\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/sept-022-copy-2nd-image.webp\" alt=\"Plant based diet for heart health \" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18636\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plant based diet for heart health<\/p><\/div>\n<p>It is completely possible to eat an adequate amount of protein from plant-based sources including beans, lentils, whole grains, tofu, nuts, seeds etc.\u00a0 These are wonderfully anti-inflammatory and alkalizing protein sources, however, bear in mind that these sources provide lower amounts than animal foods so you will need to consume larger quantities and some at every meal.\u00a0 It is also important to remember that you will need to properly combine protein sources (such as legumes and whole grains) to get the full compliment of amino acids.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dont_Forget_Lifestyle_Factors\">Don\u2019t Forget Lifestyle Factors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While a healthy diet is crucial for cardiovascular health, other factors play an equally important role:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exercise \u2013 has been shown to reduce body weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, aid circulation and improve insulin sensitivity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Stress Management &#8211; According to the Harvard Medical School, stress from challenging situations and events plays a significant role in cardiovascular symptoms and outcome, particularly heart attack risk. Ensure you get enough sleep, practice mindfulness, yoga or meditation and nurture yourself from time-to-time, socialize or take up a hobby.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Quit Smoking \u2013 chemicals in cigarettes are highly damaging to all tissues including your arteries, lungs and heart \u2013 they promote inflammation and oxidation and increase heart rate and blood pressure. Cigarettes and a healthy heart just don\u2019t go together.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Supplements_For_Heart_Health\">Supplements For Heart Health<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Coenzyme_Q_10_The_Energizer\">Coenzyme Q 10 \u2013 The Energizer<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Every cell in the body contains powerhouses called mitochondria and due to its ceaseless movement, heart cells have more than most.\u00a0 Coenzyme Q 10 is an important factor in energy production for the heart, it is also antioxidant and helps reduce hypertension.\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/3-little-known-awesome-heart-helpers\/\">Supplementation<\/a> of 100-150mg per day has been shown to be protective to the heart and increases overall energy levels.\u00a0It is especially important to take this supplement if you are on statin (anti-cholesterol) medication as statins significantly impair the body\u2019s ability to make this nutrient naturally.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Magnesium_8211_The_Relaxer\">Magnesium &#8211; The Relaxer<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The heart muscle requires magnesium to enable it to relax after each contraction and low magnesium levels can be associated with an irregular heart beat, hypertension and heart attack. 300-600mg per day is cardio-protective.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fish_Oil_The_Cleaner\">Fish Oil \u2013 The Cleaner<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Evidence supporting the cardio-protective nature of fish-oil is so strong that the American Heart Association guidelines recommend all Americans to consume omega-3 rich fish or fish oil every week at a dosage of 1-4 grams per day. Fish oil reduces heart rate and balances heart rhythm, increases HDL and reduces inflammation, triglycerides, LDL, blood pressure and overall risk of cardiovascular disease.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Glutathione_The_Detoxifier\">Glutathione \u2013 The Detoxifier<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Glutathione is a key detoxifier and antioxidant and, at a dosage of 500-1000mg per day, evidence supports it\u2019s role in reducing both inflammation and the oxidation of LDL cholesterol which can lead to the build up of dangerous plaques in your arteries.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Turmeric_curcumin_The_Protector\">Turmeric (curcumin) \u2013 The Protector<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Inflammation plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric is anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, helps lower total cholesterol, inhibits platelet aggregation and prevents the oxidation of dangerous LDL cholesterol, which is the main component of atherosclerotic plaques.\u00a0 A dose of 100-300mg per day is beneficial.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Bottom_Line\">The Bottom Line<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Heart health can be better guaranteed by the promotion of a whole-food diet and the elimination of vegetable oils, sugars, refined grains, and other industrial food products that tend to displace real food on our modern menus. The health benefits of vegan\/vegetarian diets are likely caused by the elimination of harmful ingredients and processed foods and a healthier lifestyle, as much as by avoiding a moderate amount of animal foods. Either way, a healthier diet and lifestyle means a healthier heart and a healthier you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Why Is A Preventable Disease The Number
