The risk is seen even in newer birth control pills, which supposedly, have lower doses of hormones.<\/p>\n<p>The study, which was done in Denmark, involved nearly 1.8 million women under the age of 50. The study began in 1995 and followed these women for nearly 11 years. It compared women who purchased birth control methods (including pills) with women who developed breast cancer. Researchers found the use of any hormonal contraceptive for five years or more increased the risk of breast cancer by 20 percent. Women who used hormonal contraceptives for 10 years or more were at a 38 percent greater risk of breast cancer.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Problem_Birth_Control_Pills_Are_Prescribed_For_Many_Other_Hormonal_Health_Issues\">The Problem: Birth Control Pills Are Prescribed For Many Other Hormonal Health Issues<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While the study focuses on the use of birth control pills for preventing pregnancy, there is a bigger reason to worry.<\/p>\n<p>Birth control pills contain man-made female hormones \u2013 estrogen and progesterone. Typically, these hormones are made by the ovaries naturally. However, women with hormonal imbalance issues see fluctuations in the production of these hormones.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, birth control pills are prescribed for a range of hormonal health issues, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)<\/li>\n<li>Irregular or absent periods<\/li>\n<li>Heavy periods<\/li>\n<li>Menstrual cramps<\/li>\n<li>Acne<\/li>\n<li>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)<\/li>\n<li>Endometriosis<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At Sepalika, we have always maintained that birth control pills are not a long-term solution for correcting hormonal imbalances. Apart from increasing the risk of cancer, birth control pills come with a host of other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/side-effects-birth-control-pills\/\">side effects<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some natural alternatives to birth control pills for fixing hormonal imbalances.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Fixing_Hormonal_Health_Issues_Natural_Alternatives_To_Birth_Control_Pills\">Fixing Hormonal Health Issues: Natural Alternatives To Birth Control Pills<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Eat_adequate_healthy_fats\">Eat adequate healthy fats<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Remember, your body needs fats for hormonal health. In fact, fats are a raw material for producing hormones. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/lchf-diet-pcos\/\">low-carb high fat (LCHF)<\/a> diet helps in addressing insulin resistance, the key cause of hormonal imbalance.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Keep_a_check_on_your_caffeine_intake\">Keep a check on your caffeine intake<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Too much coffee can worsen your hormonal imbalance issues. Make sure you don\u2019t have more than 2 cups of coffee every day. Try substituting coffee with herbal teas like spearmint tea. If you want to have coffee, add 1 tablespoon coconut oil to it as it is a rich source of healthy fats.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Get_enough_sleep\">Get enough sleep<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Lack of sufficient sleep can mess with your hormonal health. During sleep, your body gets very active in creating hormones. It is advisable to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day (including on weekends) to maintain your hormonal cycle.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Use_supplements_to_your_advantage\">Use supplements to your advantage<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Make sure your body gets enough of zinc, Vitamin D, omega 3 fatty acids, magnesium,\u00a0and calcium. If you\u2019re not getting enough of these nutrients through your diet,\u00a0 consider taking them in supplement form. There are also certain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-treatment-in-ayurveda\/\">ayurvedic supplements<\/a>, which can help address your hormonal imbalances.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Exercise_for_hormonal_health\">Exercise for hormonal health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There are several exercises that are specifically designed for hormonal health. For example, Aviva method is a globally-renowned method of exercises for improving hormonal health. There are also specific yoga asanas that are beneficial for hormonal disorders like PCOS.<\/p>\n<p>Simple lifestyle changes like these can go on a long way in improving hormonal health. Instead of resorting to birth control pills, you need to look at natural ways that can provide a long-term solution to your hormonal imbalances.<\/p>\n<p>Sepalika\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos-treatment-plan\/\">5-petal PCOD program<\/a> is benefiting women with PCOS and hormonal health issues all over India.
