You\u2019re not alone. We live in a fast-paced world where many of us embrace fatigue as a part of life. But when you are a woman with PCOS, fatigue can take a whole new meaning.\u00a0For many women living with PCOS, fatigue sets in even before the day can begin. You\u2019re too tired to get out of bed\u2026.you\u2019re too tired for your morning jog\u2026you\u2019re too tired to even make a healthy breakfast. And you tiredness only worsens as the day progresses.\u00a0So what\u2019s going on? Let&#8217;s find out the connection between PCOS and fatigue, and can you do something about it?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"PCOS_And_Fatigue_Whats_Going_On\">PCOS And Fatigue: What\u2019s Going On?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Hormonal imbalance lies at the very heart of PCOS. It also makes you more vulnerable to physical, mental and environmental stressors like a poor diet, lack of exercise, sleep deprivation and building up stress.<\/p>\n<p>Learn about the underlying causes and get a practical approach for managing PCOS fatigue. If you suffer from PCOS, neglecting your own needs can manifest itself in the form of fatigue. That\u2019s when your afternoon slump is more than just feeling sluggish. The hormonal imbalances going on in your body, coupled with stress, cause rapid changes in blood sugar and insulin levels.<\/p>\n<p>PCOS and fatigue may make you feel:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Too tired to get out of bed in the mornings<\/li>\n<li>Extremely sleepy and tired by afternoon<\/li>\n<li>Suffer from shakes and sweating<\/li>\n<li>Have headaches, migraines, and weakness<\/li>\n<li>Experience vision changes<\/li>\n<li>Or a combination of all of the above<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24520755\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studies<\/a> have found that approximately 50-70% of all women with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) may have some degree of insulin resistance. With insulin dysfunction comes <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40618-015-0372-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hyperinsulinemia<\/a> wherein the body pumps out more and more insulin in an effort to normalize blood glucose levels. It\u2019s this hyperinsulinemia and fluctuations in blood sugar that is the primary reason behind periods of profound fatigue in women with PCOS.<\/p>\n<p>What you need is a PCOS plan to beat fatigue! With a couple of minor lifestyle changes, you can boost your energy levels and start to feel more human.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"PCSO_And_Fatigue_Causes_And_What_Can_You_Do_About_Them\">PCSO And Fatigue: Causes And What Can You Do About Them<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Always running on empty?

You may feel your fatigue rise and drop in waves, and always feel a bit better right after you eat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Can You Do About It?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The key to correcting imbalanced blood sugar levels is to eat a balanced diet. Make sure you\u2019re getting good fats, complex carbohydrates and healthy proteins in every meal. Don\u2019t worry about calculating the exact macronutrient profile if that simply adds to your stress levels. Instead, try this simple 4-step approach:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fill up one-half of your plate with any <strong>non-starchy vegetables<\/strong> of your choice. Examples are: lettuce, broccoli, zucchini, spinach, carrots, beans, asparagus, and tomatoes.<\/li>\n<li>Next, fill one-quarter of your plate with a <strong>lean protein<\/strong> of your choice. Examples are: poached salmon, tuna, grilled chicken or turkey breast, and eggs.<\/li>\n<li>Fill the last quarter of your plate with <strong>carbohydrate-dense foods.<\/strong> We recommend white and sweet potatoes, quinoa, oats, brown rice, fruit, and root vegetables like squash and beets.<\/li>\n<li>Cook or top your vegetables and protein with <strong>healthy fats.<\/strong> Good examples are nuts, seeds, extra-virgin olive oil, organic coconut oil, grass-fed butter and ghee, coconut and avocados.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To keep your blood sugar levels balanced, what you eat is just as important as when you eat. It\u2019s important to eat regularly. Ensure you eat your breakfast within 1.5 hours of waking up. If you\u2019re feeling fatigued, it\u2019s a good idea to eat mini-meals every 4 hours. I simply divide my lunch and dinner each into two individual boxes \u2013 1 meal turns into 2 portions. And that simplifies my life! I just have to eat a portion of food every 3-4 hours post breakfast.<\/p>\n<p>Along with regularized meals, you can also try cinnamon and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/d-chiro-inositol-pcos-dosage\/\">inositol<\/a> to help balance blood sugar levels.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Youre_Not_Getting_Enough_Sleep\">You\u2019re Not Getting Enough Sleep<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_20407\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Youre-Not-Getting-Enough-Sleep.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20407\" class=\"wp-image-20407 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Youre-Not-Getting-Enough-Sleep.webp\" alt=\"pcos and fatigue\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20407\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">You\u2019re Not Getting Enough Sleep<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Lying in bed for 8 hours every night doesn\u2019t ensure a good night\u2019s sleep. If you\u2019re spending a lot of those hours tossing and turning in bed or worrying about next day\u2019s to-do list, your fatigue could be caused by lack of sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/diabetes-and-sleep-apnea\/\">sleep affects your blood sugar levels<\/a>. Lack of sleep can lead to insulin resistance, increased fatigue as well as weight gain. If you aren\u2019t getting 7-8 hours of shut-eye, or have trouble falling asleep at night and waking up in the morning, you need to prioritize sleep.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Can You Do About It?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of life\u2019s great certainties, you\u2019re not the only one who takes a good night\u2019s sleep for granted.\u00a0 Sleep is not a luxury. Your body needs it to repair, recover and regenerate. So it\u2019s crucial that you prioritize sleep over all else for a minimum of 7 to 9 hours a day. Here are some things we recommend:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A good bedtime routine can help prepare your body for a night of rest. Follow a strict routine wherein you sleep and wake up at the same time. Erratic sleep hours can throw your natural sleep body clock out of whack.<\/li>\n<li>Eliminate any blue light exposure a couple hours before bedtime. Blue light emanated from electronic devices negatively affects health and sleep patterns. Even dim lights (from electronics and energy-efficient lamps) can interfere with your sleep. Either banish all electronics from your bedroom or wear blue light blocking glasses when you must.<\/li>\n<li>While we don\u2019t think women with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/coffee-and-pcos\/\">PCOS shouldn\u2019t drink coffee<\/a>, it\u2019s a good idea to cut back on caffeine if you\u2019re feeling fatigued. Coffee can exert extra stress on the adrenal glands, weakening them over time. Your coffee addiction could add to chronic lethargy, hormonal disruption, anxiousness, and irritability. Caffeine also interferes with a peaceful night\u2019s sleep, so you want to ensure you have your last cup before 3 pm.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If your sleep rhythm has been thrown off due to PCOS and fatigue, and you\u2019re looking for ways to ensure a good night\u2019s sleep,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/sleep\/try-natural-sleep-remedies\/\"> try natural sleep remedies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"You_Are_Over-Stressed\">You Are Over-Stressed<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_20408\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/You-Are-Over-Stressed.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20408\" class=\"wp-image-20408 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/You-Are-Over-Stressed.webp\" alt=\"pcos and fatigue\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20408\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">You Are Over-Stressed<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Nothing will worsen PCOS and fatigue like being stressed out. While we would all like to avoid stress altogether, that\u2019s a rather unrealistic expectation. Physical, emotional and environmental stress can\u2019t simply be eliminated from our modern lifestyle, but they sure can be managed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Can You Do About It?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simplify your life. There is nothing worse than wanting to call it a day, but your day-planner telling you that you\u2019re not even half-way through your day\u2019s commitments. It\u2019s time to shorten your to-do list till you\u2019ve overcome PCOS and fatigue.<\/li>\n<li>Make time for rest. We all need breaks\u2026 and you need them even more than others. Schedule a 30-minute break during lunch and another one when you get back from work. This \u2018ME\u2019 time can help you relax, unwind, and drink a cup of herbal tea in peace. You\u2019d be surprised by how refreshed you feel after you\u2019ve put your feet up for a little while.<\/li>\n<li>If stress has taken over your life, it\u2019s time to take mindfulness practices seriously. Make the time to practice yoga and meditation. Feeling stressed-out all the time can stimulate a hormonal response in your body, which you truly don\u2019t need. Over time, this unmanaged stress will give way to adrenal fatigue. There\u2019s a growing body of evidence that shows <a href=\"http:\/\/www.endocrine-abstracts.org\/ea\/0020\/ea0020s1.3.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PCOS patients have a hyper-responsive HPA<\/a> or Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis. A dysfunctioning HPA axis is closely linked to fatigue.<\/li>\n<li>Light exercises like walking, swimming, yoga, and cycling can also help fight stress. You may feel you\u2019re too tired to exercise, but just get on with it. Soon the rush of endorphins released from exercising will make you feel a lot better.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You can also try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/ashwagandha-the-one-must-have-herb-for-all-of-us\/\">Ashwagandha<\/a> as a natural remedy to manage stress.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_Diet_Isnt_Right_For_You\">Your Diet Isn\u2019t Right For You<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_20409\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Your-Diet-Isnt-Right-For-You.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20409\" class=\"wp-image-20409 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Your-Diet-Isnt-Right-For-You.webp\" alt=\"pcos and fatigue\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20409\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Your Diet Isn\u2019t Right For You<\/p><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s not surprising that the wrong diet will worsen PCOS and fatigue.

Fiber digests slowly, so your sugars are absorbed into the blood at a slower pace.<\/li>\n<li>Eat good proteins in every single meal. Eggs, lean meat, and fish are all good options.<\/li>\n<li>Add healthy fats like grass-fed butter, coconut oil, ghee, extra-virgin olive oil, avocados, fatty fish, nuts and seeds to your diet<\/li>\n<li>Remove dairy and gluten from your diet, as many women with PCOS could be intolerant to them.<\/li>\n<li>Add gut-friendly probiotics to your diet to help balance out the gut microbiome.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We advise you add more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/omega-3-pcos\/\">Omega 3 to your PCOS<\/a> diet as it can bring relief from a variety of <a href=\"http:\/\/pcos symptoms\">PCOS symptoms<\/a> including fatigue.

Some of the conditions commonly seen in women with PCOS women include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Iron deficiency:<\/strong>\u00a0It\u2019s not uncommon for women with PCOS to become anemic when their monthly period has been too heavy. Get your iron levels checked, and discuss the right diet and supplement guide to boost iron levels.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Food Intolerances:<\/strong>\u00a0Many women with PCOS have gluten and dairy sensitivity. Even if you don\u2019t have a full blown gluten or dairy allergy, your fatigue could be a symptom of intolerance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hypothyroidism:\u00a0<\/strong>An underactive thyroid gland can also exacerbate fatigue. Get a full thyroid panel done; just TSH levels aren\u2019t enough for a proper diagnosis.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vitamin B12 Deficiency:<\/strong>\u00a0Another common ailment in women with PCOS. Women who are on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/side-effects-birth-control-pills\/\">birth control pills <\/a>or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/metformin-for-pcos\/\">metformin<\/a> to treat PCOS are particularly susceptible to vitamin B12 deficiency, which causes chronic fatigue.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sleep Apnea:\u00a0<\/strong>Obstructive sleep apnea is common with PCOS, so it\u2019s best to get tested if your sleep quality is rather poor despite trying all natural remedies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clinical Depression:<\/strong>\u00a0Women with PCOS are at greater risk of mental health problems, such as anxiety and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-depression\/\">depression<\/a>.
