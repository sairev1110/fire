Given that PCOS is also associated with insulin resistance, doctors started prescribing Metformin for this hormonal disorder as well. Let\u2019s understand the role of metformin for PCOS in detail.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Insulin_Resistance_The_Reason_Behind_Prescribing_Metformin_For_PCOS\">Insulin Resistance: The Reason Behind Prescribing Metformin For PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Insulin resistance is a common condition in a majority of PCOS patients. Experts believe it is a key reason behind this condition. If you\u2019re experiencing insulin resistance, your body fails to respond to normal levels of insulin. \u00a0As a result, glucose starts to accumulate in the blood. To tackle excess blood sugar, the pancreas produce more insulin. This condition is called <em>hyperinsulinemia<\/em> or the presence of excessive insulin in the blood.<\/p>\n<p>High levels of insulin in the body trigger the over-production of male hormones in the female body. Excess male hormones in the female body lead to symptoms of PCOS such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-acne\/\">acne<\/a>, excess body hair, \u00a0male pattern baldness, and belly fat.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Metformin_For_PCOS_8211_How_Does_It_Work\">Metformin For PCOS &#8211; How Does It Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The USFDA approved metformin in 1994. Metformin for PCOS works in the following ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving insulin sensitivity of cells, thus helping reduce insulin levels in the blood<\/li>\n<li>Curbing the production of glucose inside the liver<\/li>\n<li>Increasing the absorption of glucose by cells, and<\/li>\n<li>Inhibiting the use of fatty acids for production of energy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doctors also figured out that prescribing metformin for PCOS helped patients in regularizing their periods. They also found that the drug helped in reducing the levels of male hormones in PCOS patients.<\/p>\n<p>PCOS patients have to undergo something called as \u201covary stimulation\u201d prior to IVF treatment. Doctors prescribe Metformin for PCOS to reduce the risk of a condition called <em>ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, <\/em>a medical condition in which the ovaries become painful. Metformin also helps women to produce eggs of a better quality. Some studies suggest that using Metformin for PCOS can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16253975\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">decrease the risks of miscarriage in PCOS women<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Women are also at a risk of developing gestational diabetes during pregnancy. This is a temporary condition that gets better on its own after the woman gives birth. Women who have suffered from gestational diabetes stand a higher chance of developing full-blown type 2 diabetes in the future. Because women with PCOS already are suffering from insulin resistance, they have a higher risk of gestational diabetes. Metformin for PCOS seems to reduce the chances of gestational diabetes in pregnant PCOS patients.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is no research to support that using metformin for PCOS helps in losing weight. You should use Metformin for PCOS only with appropriate changes in diet and lifestyle to support weight loss. Also, metformin should only be used if there is a clear case of insulin resistance. Unfortunately, the connection between weight loss by Metformin for PCOS is at best unclear.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Metformin8217s_For_PCOS_Are_There_Any_Long-Term_Health_Benefits\">Metformin&#8217;s For PCOS: Are There Any Long-Term Health Benefits?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Insulin resistance is central to the advancement of PCOS. The treatment of PCOS revolves around reducing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. This is a key reason why doctors prescribe metformin for PCOS.<\/p>\n<p>However, we should not forget that PCOS is not just a reproductive disorder. It is a life condition that can have serious health complications. Heart disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and endometrial cancer are some risks associated with PCOS. All these risks are linked to obesity and insulin resistance. Metformin works in reducing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, it can offer long-term disease protection to women with PCOS.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Are_the_Side_Effects_of_Metformin_For_PCOS\">What Are the Side Effects of Metformin For PCOS?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20338\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/AR-and-Constipation.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20338\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20338\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/AR-and-Constipation.webp\" alt=\"What Are the Side Effects of Metformin For PCOS?\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20338\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">What Are the Side Effects of Metformin For PCOS?<\/p><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Digestive issues, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Stomach or abdominal discomfort<\/li>\n<li>Diarrhea<\/li>\n<li>Nausea<\/li>\n<li>Flatulence<\/li>\n<li>Bloating<\/li>\n<li>Reduced appetite<\/li>\n<li>Anorexia<\/li>\n<li>Metallic taste<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Fatigue<\/li>\n<li>Red blood cells becoming too large<\/li>\n<li>Cough or hoarseness of voice<\/li>\n<li>Tingling or numbness in the palms and feet<\/li>\n<li>Pain in the lower back or in the flanks (sides)<\/li>\n<li>Muscle pain or cramping<\/li>\n<li>Hair loss<\/li>\n<li>Shallow breathing<\/li>\n<li>Painful or difficult urination<\/li>\n<li>Blurred vision<\/li>\n<li>Weight gain<\/li>\n<li>Anxiety<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One of the rare <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/metformin-side-effects-pcos\/\">side effects of Metformin for PCOS <\/a>is a serious condition called lactic acidosis. This condition is common in PCOS patients who are also diabetic. This is a life-threatening condition where lactic acid accumulates in the blood and reaches dangerous levels.<\/p>\n<p>Metformin interferes with the way in which our bodies process certain vital nutrients, like vitamin B12. Many of the side effects and complications of Metformin are due to the loss of these nutrients from the body.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Metformin8217s_For_PCOS_How_Much_Should_You_Take\">Metformin&#8217;s For PCOS: How Much Should You Take?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20337\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Metformin-1.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20337\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20337\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Metformin-1.webp\" alt=\"Metformin For PCOS: How Much Should You Take?\" width=\"706\" height=\"334\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20337\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Metformin For PCOS: How Much Should You Take?<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Metformin is available as a pill or liquid. Significant responses are not observed at a dosage of less than 1000 mg. Doctors usually start off with metformin for PCOS with a single dose of 500 mg with your largest meal. This is to avoid digestive issues.<\/p>\n<p>Once you tolerate this dosage, doctors will increase the dosage to 500 mg taken twice, once with lunch and once with dinner. If this dosage is also tolerated well, your doctor will increase it to 500 mg three times \u2013 with breakfast, lunch and dinner. The target dose of metformin for PCOS is in the range of 1500-2500 mg per day.<\/p>\n<p>An extended-release version of the pill is also available. You have to take it once a day. It is long acting and will keep on releasing a constant amount of metformin in your body.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Health_Tips_If_You_Are_Taking_Metformin_For_PCOS8217s\">Health Tips If You Are Taking Metformin For PCOS&#8217;s<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Do not take metformin for PCOS if you have a liver of kidney problem. Drink enough water to keep yourself hydrated while you are on Metformin. Also, if you\u2019re on Metformin, you should be cautious while drinking alcohol. Both Metformin and alcohol put stress on liver, therefore limit your drinking if you\u2019re on this drug.<\/p>\n<p>If, for any reason, you are not going to eat food for a long time (like before or after a surgery) while on Metformin for PCOS, you need to consult your doctor. They may advise you to stop taking Metformin until you resume eating again. Also, before undergoing any test that requires the ingestion of a \u201ccontrast dye\u201d (contrast X-ray or CT-scan), you need to stop taking metformin for up to 48 hours before and after the test. In general, always consult your doctor before doing anything that is different from your normal.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Metformin8217s_For_PCOS_Final_Thoughts\">Metformin&#8217;s For PCOS: Final Thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Metformin is among the most important drugs in allopathic medicines. It does have a wide spectrum of effects on the body, which makes it a great choice for a variety of disorders, including diabetes. However, you cannot ignore its negative effects on the body. As it depletes vital nutrients, using Metformin for PCOS may do more harm than good in the long term.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, Metformin for PCOS is prescribed because of the drug&#8217;s ability to deal with insulin resistance. However, there are other holistic ways to improve insulin resistance. A combination of diet, lifestyle changes, stress management and regular exercise can help in improving your body\u2019s sensitivity towards insulin. This improvement will go a long way in dealing with the symptoms of PCOS and eventually reversing the condition.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
