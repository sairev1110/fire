In 2004 the Scripps Research Institute proposed a theory that chronic inflammation is central to the development of AD, noting that it caused proteins to \u201cmisfold\u201d to form the amyloid plaques of AD.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Boosting_Brain_Health\">Boosting Brain Health<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18521\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/barin-fog_food_1-2.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18521\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18521\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/barin-fog_food_1-2.webp\" alt=\"Manage brain fog with healthy food\" width=\"779\" height=\"779\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18521\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Manage brain fog with healthy food<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"CHOOSE_These_food_and_lifestyle_factors_to_enhance_brain_function\">CHOOSE: These food and lifestyle factors to enhance brain function\u2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whole foods<\/strong> \u2013We don\u2019t mean the brand, but the stuff that Mother Nature makes. While foods contain antioxidant nutrients and help reduce inflammation. Eat 5-7 serves of colorful vegetables and leafy greens and a small amount of fruit and whole grains each day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Protein<\/strong> &#8211; provides the basis for our brain chemicals. Ideally combine a protein source with your carbohydrates to slow the release of glucose into the blood.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Healthy Fats<\/strong> \u2013 approximately 60% of the brain is made up of fat so it\u2019s really important to eat healthy fats including fish, olive oil, nuts and seeds. Omega 3 fats also significantly reduce inflammation. A fish oil supplement helps boost beneficial fats.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eggs<\/strong> \u2013 are a great source of phospholipids, that contribute directly to the insulation of the nerve fibers, ensuring smooth transmission of signals and also helps make one of the brain\u2019s memory neurotransmitters, acetylcholine. The Lecithin in egg yolk helps keep the brain cell membranes in great shape.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sleep, De-stress, Exercise<\/strong> \u2013 all aid in detoxifying the body and in healing and repair. This triad, which causes chronic disease &#8211; inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance \u2013 are all reduced by sleeping well, de-stressing and getting adequate exercise.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Challenge your mind daily<\/strong> \u2013 research suggests that mental stimulation, such as puzzles or even learning a new dance routine, is associated with higher levels of focus and cognition and with lower incidences of degenerative brain diseases.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Supplements<\/strong> &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/top-3-memory-supplements-for-brain-fog\/\">There are some wonderful, natural dietary supplements that are great brain health boosters.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"AVOID_These_substances_that_can_disrupt_and_damage_the_brain\">AVOID: These substances that can disrupt and damage the brain\u2026<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sugar<\/strong> \u2013 depletes nutrients and significantly increases inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Processed Foods including \u201cwhite grains\u201d<\/strong> \u2013 add little in the way of nutrients or fibre, but do add significantly to the sugar load in the diet.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Unhealthy Processed Fats<\/strong> \u2013 from fried food for brain health, baked goods and margarines \u2013 these contribute to inflammation and disrupt the good work of the healthy fats.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Food Additives<\/strong> \u2013 contribute to the toxic load of the body and many mimic brain chemicals causing disruption in brain function, memory, focus and behavior.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Food allergens<\/strong> \u2013 avoid any foods that cause a problem in your body such as bloating, flatulence, pain or diarrhea. Although these problems may seem like minor irritants, by eating these foods you will be contributing to inflammation and lowering the ability of your gut to absorb nutrients. Over time, the inflammation makes things a lot worse for the brain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"quote-text-new\">Ayurveda, the ancient science of healing and well being from India calls the \u201cgut\u201d the second brain.<\/div>\n<p>Keeping it healthy with the right diet and lifestyle may well be the first step in getting the most out of our gray matter.<\/p>\n<p>Know more about our program: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/painful-periods\/\">Welcome to Easing Period Pains Naturally<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Can My Eating Habits Really Affect My Thinking Habits?2 Disease States Of The Brain \u2013 Are They Fueled By Poor Nutrition, Oxidative Stress And Inflammation?3 Boosting Brain Health3.1 CHOOSE: These food and lifestyle factors to enhance brain function\u20263.2 AVOID: These substances that can disrupt and damage the brain\u2026 Can My Eating Habits [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":25,"featured_media":18522,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[69],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Simple Secrets to end Brain Fog | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Some super food for brain health have brain-protective nutrients that stave off negative changes that come with aging.
