Do you see your kids and grandkids only around the holidays or when they do a grocery run for you? Are the only people you see regularly on a TV set?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re upwards of 55\u201360 and answered yes to the above questions, you are not, pardon the pun, alone.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Isolation_A_Widespread_Malady\">Isolation: A Widespread Malady<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A recent study in the Journal of Primary Prevention, entitled \u201cA Review of Social Isolation,\u201d noted that nearly 43% of seniors who lived within the general community (as opposed to seniors-only communities) may suffer from social isolation, &#8220;a state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others, has a minimal number of social contacts, and is deficient in fulfilling and quality relationships.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Is_It_For_Real\">Is It For Real?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Should we take this seriously, or is it just another new \u201ccondition\u201d invented by the media and big pharma to put us on another \u201cmagic pill\u201d to cure it?<\/p>\n<p>According to a 2012 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), \u201cboth social isolation and loneliness are associated with a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/110\/15\/5797.full\"><b>higher risk of mortality<\/b><\/a>\u00a0in adults aged 52 and older.\u201d The study found that socially isolated individuals are at increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease infectious illnesses, cognitive deterioration and mortality. Social isolation also has been associated with elevated levels of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/herbs-lower-blood-pressure\/\">blood pressure<\/a>, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen<sup>, <\/sup>as well as with heightened inflammatory and metabolic responses to stress.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Health_In_Numbers\">Health In Numbers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The reasons for this are manifold; for one, if you\u2019re scared of taking the bus, you may put away the visit to the doctor. Lack of engagement with other people reduces your brain\u2019s need to plan, understand, rationalize, and argue, and this could lead to cognitive decline. Not being able to discuss your worries and concerns can literally increase the \u201cburden\u201d on your heart. Above all, being social creatures, isolation has system-wide effects on human beings and can cause us to literally die sooner!<\/p>\n<p>Dr. John Cacioppo, Professor at the University of Chicago, who has studied social isolation for more than 25 years, says, \u201cWhen you take a social animal\u2026whether it be a fruit fly or a rodent or a dog or a horse\u2026 when you take one and isolate that animal, they die earlier.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Re-connect_With_Life\">Re-connect With Life<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18454\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/ljkkj.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18454\" class=\"wp-image-18454 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/ljkkj.webp\" alt=\"how to connect with life\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">reconnect with someone<\/p><\/div>\n<p>So what can you do? Here are 5 simple things that you can do to keep isolation at bay and stay \u201cplugged in\u201d to life!<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Get_Moving\">Get Moving!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with the public transport in your area. Pick a simple route, from your home to say, your friend\u2019s home, and take it one day. Give yourself a treat when you are done. Check with your local community center for help in planning and executing this. Ruth Stella is a senior who runs a free program to teach other seniors to use public transport. \u201cPublic transit keeps your mind and body healthy, connected to loved ones and your community, helps mother earth, and is very kind to the pocket book, \u201c she says on a blog.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Find_Purpose\">Find Purpose!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Executive coach and author Richar J. Leider investigated the reasons that people felt isolated after retirement and sought their opinion on what they would do differently if given a second chance. Almost uniformly, most respondents said they \u201cwanted their lives to matter, to have made a difference.\u201d Helping another and making a difference to the life of a fellow human being can be the master key to ending your own isolation. One simple way could be to volunteer; to offer your life\u2019s experience and knowledge to others. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalservice.gov\/programs\/senior-corps\/rsvp\"><b>RSVP<\/b><\/a>, a program of Senior Corps, is one of the largest senior volunteer groups in the country, with close to 300,000 volunteers in a wide range of areas. Others like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalservice.gov\/programs\/senior-corps\/senior-corps-programs\/foster-grandparents\"><b>Foster Grandparents<\/b><\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nationalservice.gov\/programs\/senior-corps\/senior-companions\"><b>The Senior Companion Program<\/b><\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seniorshelpingseniors.com\/\"><b>Seniors Helping Seniors<\/b><\/a> offer very good options too.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Take_Care_Of_Another_Life\">Take Care Of Another Life!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>A potted plant or a pet can add meaning to day-to-day existence in a way that few other things can. Pets provide companionship, encourage an active routine and give purpose. A study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society noted, \u201csenior citizens who own pets are less likely to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/mental-health\/depression-and-chemical-imbalance\/\">depressed<\/a>, are better able to tolerate social isolation, and are more active than those who do not own pets.\u201d You can find pet adoption resources <a href=\"http:\/\/www.petsfortheelderly.org\/index.html.\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Look_And_Feel_Good\">Look And Feel Good!<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Fix_Your_Health_Problems\">Fix Your Health Problems!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Hearing and eyesight tests can help us identify and fix embarrassing problems that may have developed slowly over a period of time and become debilitating. If you can\u2019t read the sign in the subway or hear the waiter at a restaurant, you\u2019re unlikely to want to leave home. And yet, the answer can be as simple as a new pair or glasses or an invisible in-ear hearing aid. In a New York Times article on getting over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/simple-secrets-to-manage-brain-fog\/\">mental blocks<\/a>, a woman from Wisconsin said, \u201cI want to talk to everyone I know and say, \u2018Get over the shyness about hearing aids\u2014life can be better.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Adopt_A_Positive_Body_Image\">Adopt A Positive Body Image!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Take care of yourself. In the PNAS study mentioned earlier, author Nicholson says, \u201cIndividuals with a poor body image attributable to being overweight may decrease or cease interactions with their social networks to the point where they could be at risk for social isolation.\u201d Take that step to look after yourself. Mother Nature has much to offer in terms of things that can help you lose weight in a healthy way, have radiant skin and hair, sleep better, and more. Looking great on the outside begins with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/immunity\/coq10-nutrient-for-boosting-immunity\/\">great immunity inside<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/sleep\/try-natural-sleep-remedies\/\">sleeping well<\/a>. You can look good and feel great at any age!<\/p>\n<p>So go ahead and make the change; plug back into society and make the next 5 decades the best ones of your life!<\/p>\n<p>Read More: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/cystic-acne\/\">Control Your Cystic Acne, Naturally<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A recent study noted that nearly 43% of seniors who lived within the general community (as opposed to senior-only communities) may suffer from social isolation, \u201ca state in which the individual lacks a sense of belonging socially, lacks engagement with others and has a minimal number of social contacts.
