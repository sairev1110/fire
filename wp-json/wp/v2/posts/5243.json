This is a condition called<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Insulin_resistance\"> insulin resistance.<\/a> Thiazolidinediones (TZDs or Glitazones) are a class of drugs that<a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/diabetes\/thiazolidinediones-for-type-2-diabetes\"> reduce insulin resistance<\/a>. When cells resist insulin (the hormone produced by the pancreas that helps control blood sugar levels), it means insulin is being produced but isn\u2019t being used effectively in the body. The insulin is unable to deliver sugar to muscle and fat cells, so sugar backs up in the bloodstream instead. Please note, that thiazolidinediones don\u2019t increase insulin production. They increase the effect of the available insulin, reducing insulin resistance at a cellular level.<\/p>\n<p>Thiazolidinediones are used alongside a diet and exercise program and, also, with other medications, for the treatment of T2D.<\/p>\n<p>Thiazolidinedione is not used in the treatment of:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Type 1 diabetes &#8211; A condition in which the body is unable to produce insulin and, therefore, cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood.<br \/>\n&gt; Diabetic ketoacidosis &#8211; A serious condition that may develop if high blood sugar is not treated.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"Most_Prescribed_Names_In_This_Category_of_Drugs_Include&quot;\"><span id=\"Most_Prescribed_Names_In_This_Category_of_Drugs_Include\">Most Prescribed Names In This Category of Drugs Include<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avandia (Rosiglitazone)<\/li>\n<li>Actos (Pioglitazone)<\/li>\n<li>Pioz Mf-G<\/li>\n<li>Triglycomet<\/li>\n<li>Trigulin<\/li>\n<li>Piomed<\/li>\n<li>Glucut-GMP<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Rosiglitazone and Pioglitazone are two drugs in this class that have faced a lot of flak due to safety concerns. Both of these drugs work by increasing the body&#8217;s sensitivity to insulin.<\/p>\n<p>Often, the side effects of TZDs are anticipated by doctors. But, you need to be aware of them so that you can flag them to your doctor in case they show up.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"How_Should_This_Medicine_Be_Used\"><span id=\"How_Should_This_Medicine_Be_Used\">How Should This Medicine Be Used?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Thiazolidinediones (Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone) are available in tablet form. Pioglitazone is usually taken once daily, while Rosiglitazone is usually taken once or twice daily. Both may be taken with or without meals. But, it is important to <a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/druginfo\/meds\/a699016.html\">take the medication <\/a>at the same time every day.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should, also, follow the directions mentioned on your prescription leaflet with utmost care.<\/li>\n<li>Clarify any part of it that you do not understand with your healthcare practitioner or pharmacist.<\/li>\n<li>Always take the medication as per the directions given by your healthcare practitioner or pharmacist.<\/li>\n<li>It could prove dangerous to consume more or less of a dose or to take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"Side_Effects_That_Could_Occur_As_Soon_As_You_Start_Taking_the_Medication\"><span id=\"Side_Effects_That_Could_Occur_As_Soon_As_You_Start_Taking_the_Medication\">Side Effects That Could Occur As Soon As You Start Taking the Medication<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The most <a href=\"http:\/\/www.diabetes.co.uk\/diabetes-medication\/thiazolidinediones.html\">common side effects <\/a>of Thiazolidinediones that you could face are &#8211;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water retention \u2013 Leading to swelling or edema, including a feeling of heaviness in the body and tendency to be inactive.<\/li>\n<li>Cardiac issues \u2013 Including increased blood pressure, because of which there is elevated pressure on the heart as well. This could eventually lead to heart failure.<\/li>\n<li>Increased cholesterol levels \u2013 The medication has been shown to elevate LDL levels in patients.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let us take a look at each of the above common side effects in detail.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Water_Retention\"><span id=\"Water_Retention\">Water Retention<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The body\u2019s salt balance is determined by your diet and body type and is usually well regulated.\u00a0 Thiazolidinediones can upset this delicate balance and cause the kidneys to retain salt. Since the body needs to keep the corrosive salt diluted, it begins to retain water. This excess water puts pressure on your circulatory system. It seeps out of the blood vessels and accumulates within your body, leading to edema and swelling.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Heart_Failure\"><span id=\"Heart_Failure\">Heart Failure<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18730\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Heart-failure.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18730\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18730\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Heart-failure.webp\" alt=\"Heart Failure is a side -effect of TZD\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18730\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Heart Failure is a side -effect of TZD<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The connection between thiazolidinediones and heart failure has been studied in detail. Prolonged use of thiazolidinediones may lead to a considerable amount of fluid retention. This increases the pressure on the heart and can lead to heart failure. The circulatory system of the body is a closed system, with the amount of fluid determining the blood pressure you feel. If there is too much pressure on the heart, failure is a possibility.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"Increased_Low-density_lipoprotein_LDL_cholesterol_Levels\"><span id=\"Increased_Low-density_lipoprotein_LDL_cholesterol_Levels\">Increased Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol Levels<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may notice an increase in your LDL levels after initiating thiazolidinedione therapy. Rosiglitazone has a much more pronounced effect in increasing serum LDL levels than pioglitazone.<\/p>\n<p>(LDL cholesterol is considered the \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol because it is responsible for the generation of plaque &#8211; a thick, hard deposit that can block arteries and make them rigid.)<\/p>\n<p>TZDs have not been studied for nutrient depletion effects.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What_Can_You_Do_About_It\"><span id=\"What_Can_You_Do_About_It\">What Can You Do About It?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>TZDs are normally prescribed only if metformin or other medications, like sulfonylureas, are not tolerated well or fail to lower blood glucose levels sufficiently.<\/p>\n<p>If you have been put on TZDs and want to continue with them, certain dietary supplements that reduce water retention and aid heart health may help to reduce their side effects.

Therefore, if rifampicin has been started or stopped during a treatment involving pioglitazone, you may need to make some changes in your treatment regimen.
