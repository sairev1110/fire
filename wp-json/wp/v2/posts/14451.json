It seems the controversy remains strong. Opinions vary about soy, from the \u2018it is healthful\u2019 side to the other end of the spectrum. Yes, people have told me sternly, soy is poison for PCOS. When we remove the passion, what is the likely truth? And is there a middle ground?\u00a0I think so.\u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at some of the facts around PCOS and soy, so you can make a better-informed choice for yourself.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Is_Soy_And_How_Is_It_Produced\">What Is Soy And How Is It Produced?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Soy is produced from soybeans, which are legumes. Soy can come as the natural bean, or in the form of soy protein, soy milk or soy fiber containing the fibrous parts of the beans. These latter three are each a processed form of soybean.<\/p>\n<p><em>Now to\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Nutrients_In_Soy_That_Are_Beneficial_For_PCOS\">Nutrients In Soy That Are Beneficial For PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Soy offers a multitude of health benefits for PCOS.<\/p>\n<p>High in protein, it is a low-cost source of amino acids. As women with PCOS need to maintain healthy protein consumption levels to aid craving avoidance and to moderate healthy blood sugar levels, soy is a helpful source. Particularly for vegans, vegetarians and those looking to reduce the inflammatory levels associated with highly processed red meat intake, this bean makes good sense.<\/p>\n<p>Soy also contains polyunsaturated fat, vitamins, and minerals such as vitamin C, folate, thiamine, iron, calcium, and magnesium, which has been shown to be lower in women with PCOS. It also contains antioxidants such as isoflavones, phytic acid, and saponins, which help to address the dangerous higher levels of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-inflammation\/\">inflammation associated with PCOS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) stated, \u201cthe addition of soy protein to a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol may also help to reduce the risk of CHD [cardiovascular disease]\u201d.\u00a0 Plus, soy may help to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3383497\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">improve bone health<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acc.org\/about-acc\/press-releases\/2012\/03\/25\/15\/19\/soybeans_bp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reduce high blood pressure<\/a>, ease symptoms of both menopause and hormonal imbalance, and boost vitality.<\/p>\n<p>Importantly for PCOS patients, \u201cConsumption of soy protein can favorably affect satiety [a feeling of fullness] and reduce excess body fat in obese\u2026 humans. Soy protein ingestion also improves insulin resistance, the hallmark of obesity and PCOS.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Other_Benefits_Of_Soy_For_PCOS\">Other Benefits Of Soy For PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20625\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Soy-milk.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20625\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20625\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Soy-milk.webp\" alt=\"Other Benefits Of Soy For PCOS\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20625\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Other Benefits Of Soy For PCOS<\/p><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>I cannot recall a woman with PCOS, who did not have some level of gut health involvement. And soy contains the fiber needed for optimal digestive function. Plus, fermentation of fiber by bacteria in the colon may lead to the formation of short chain fatty acids. Butyrate is one such product and has been shown to improve colon health, with the significant side benefit of a reduction in your risk of developing colon cancer.<\/li>\n<li>There is a link between soy protein and decreased cholesterol level.<\/li>\n<li>The bioactive proteins found in soy, such as lectin and lunasin, may have anti-cancer properties. As a result, wonderful for women with already increased risks of breast and endometrial cancer!<\/li>\n<li>The fat content in soy is mainly comprised of polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids, at odds with our over-consumption of saturated fats.<\/li>\n<li>Phytic acid may help to reduce heavy metal toxicity. Heavy metals can increase inflammation and reduce insulin sensitivity. Therefore, soy has an important role to play in a syndrome in large part affected by these issues.<\/li>\n<li>Phytoestrogens, such as those in soy, have similar features to human estrogen. As PCOS patients have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer, the finding that these plant estrogens may <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3074428\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reduce the risk of breast cancer<\/a> is noteworthy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With these important reported health benefits, what about the negative soybean controversy?<\/p>\n<p>As with any food, there is the possibility of allergy. This is no different with PCOS and soy. And this specific reaction aside, there are other possible cons, so let\u2019s take a look at these now\u2026<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Potential_Cons_of_Soy_Consumption_For_PCOS\">The Potential Cons of Soy Consumption For PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Phytic acid, as mentioned above, can absorb toxic metals. However, this metal-gathering trait of soy also encourages it to hone in on those metals we need for health. Absorption of zinc, iron, calcium, and magnesium can be negatively affected. As magnesium has been previously found to be lower in PCOS patients, and with a deficiency of this important mineral potentially contributing to high blood pressure, constipation, stress, depression and pain, this is an important consideration.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, PCOS patients are often relatively \u2018estrogen dominant\u2019 as many lack regular ovulation and the accompanying rise in progesterone in the second half of their menstrual cycle. One small study showed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8074062\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FSH [follicle stimulating hormone] levels were significantly suppressed<\/a>\u00a0by daily ingested soy. Lowered absolute or relative levels of FSH are common in PCOS and can contribute to anovulation and the cysts, or immature follicles, that form part of the Rotterdam criteria for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-diagnosis\/\">PCOS diagnosis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>So, with the above pros and cons\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Should_Women_With_PCOS_Include_Soy_In_Their_Food_Plan\">Should Women With PCOS Include Soy In Their Food Plan?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As stated by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3139237\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jefferson<\/a>, \u201cFor the most part, the studies conducted to date suggest that a diet containing lower levels of soy, e.g. 1-2 servings of soy\/d, as part of a well-balanced diet should not pose harmful effects on the function of the ovary as it relates to ovulation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are many beneficial health reasons for women with PCOS to consume soy. I eat soy regularly. A reduction in high blood pressure, better insulin sensitivity, a reduced inflammation level and a lowered risk of breast cancer, just to mention a few pros. As a vegetarian, I also enjoy tofu and the crucial protein it brings me.<\/p>\n<p>For those who choose not to drink dairy &#8211; my hand is up! &#8211; it is also a source of \u2018milk\u2019 for a soulful cup of tea.<\/p>\n<p>However, I have spoken to some women who just don\u2019t feel well when they consume soy. If this is you, opt for other ways to increase the nutrients soy offers. Protein can be found in nuts, seeds, and eggs; magnesium through spinach and almonds; fiber from leafy greens, a variety of vegetables and other legumes.<\/p>\n<p>If you do wish to include soy, how should you do so?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Guidelines_For_Including_Soy_In_Your_PCOS_Diet\">Guidelines For Including Soy In Your PCOS Diet<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Firstly, enjoy it. There are a multitude of nutrient-rich food options, so be health conscious <em>and<\/em> aware that if you don\u2019t like one food type, there are others. I start with this because some people just plain don\u2019t like soy. It\u2019s true, I don\u2019t understand this, but there you go!<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, eat it. Rather than consider a supplement, consume soy products. This way you ingest the full array of contained nutrients rather than a single, processed ingredient. It\u2019s wonderful thrown into a stir fry or mixed in a pumpkin and pine nut salad.<\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, include soy no more than once per day as the research indicates it is only with higher intakes where a potential con could rear its ugly head.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
