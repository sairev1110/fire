Well, most of them already do! Nearly 2\/3 of the world\u2019s population lives in Asia, where the spice, turmeric and curcumin, is grown and consumed daily. Adding turmeric to everyday cooking can be a powerful shot in the arm for your overall health.<\/p>\n<p>Growing up in India, spices were part of every meal for us; and they were just as important for healing. I still use turmeric in my daily cooking, apply it on cuts when my kids get hurt, use it as a paste on their forehead when they have a fever and stir it into their milk for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/sleep\/how-to-sleep-better\/\">good night\u2019s sleep<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Pass me the Super Spice, please!<\/p>\n<p>Turmeric detoxifies and supports the liver, making it a great spice to build immunity. It is also a powerful antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory. It is said to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. The active constituent in turmeric is curcumin, which gives it the yellow color. There are several studies that the National Institutes of Health list on the beneficial effects of turmeric and curcumin.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Which_Is_Better_Turmeric_Or_Curcumin\">Which Is Better: Turmeric Or Curcumin?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18456\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/turmeric-vs-curcumin-1296x728-feature.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18456\" class=\"wp-image-18456 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/turmeric-vs-curcumin-1296x728-feature-1024x575.webp\" alt=\"curcumin turmeric benefits \" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">curcumin turmeric benefits<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Turmeric is used as a powdered spice in food while curcumin is usually taken as a dietary supplement. Both have wonderful health benefits.\u00a0 When we cook with the whole turmeric, we get the benefits of all the compounds found in turmeric. It is often recommended as a gentle, time-taking healer, for systemic health challenges like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/autoimmunity-functional-doctor-reveals-key-reversal\/\">Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)<\/a>.\u00a0 Curcumin, on the other hand, is said to have a more swift and dramatic effect; it therefore offers a more convenient choice for therapeutic purposes.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Pick_The_Right_Turmeric_Supplement\">How to Pick The Right Turmeric Supplement<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It is advisable to choose a turmeric or curcumin supplement that <i>also<\/i> contains black pepper extract or piperine, because the piperine enhances absorption of the turmeric. By itself, turmeric tends to get metabolized before it can be absorbed in the human body, thereby reducing its effectiveness. So make sure that your dietary turmeric\/curcumin has piperine, so it is more \u2018bioavailable\u2019; meaning it is able to enter your cells and do its job.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Remember:<\/strong> Turmeric works gently in our body. It could take up to eight weeks of use before you see the full positive impact of supplementation with a standardized extract.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Turmeric is a largely safe supplement with no known serious adverse reactions. But do be mindful of possible interactions.\u00a0 As always, please involve your healthcare practitioner before starting turmeric supplements.
