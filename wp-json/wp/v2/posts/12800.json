The fever has reached a whopping 103 &#8211; 104 degrees. The body is weak, no food stays in, eyes are changing color, an incessant headache builds, and refuses to leave. As a parent, all you want is for your child to feel better and for the discomfort to end. So your first instinct &#8211; give the child an antipyretic in the form of a paracetamol or an ibuprofen or an aspirin, and bring the fever down as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Well, we\u2019re here to tell you that there\u2019s another way around it.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Its_Time_to_Embrace_The_Fever\">It\u2019s Time to Embrace The Fever!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, fever isn\u2019t something to be feared. When there is a bacterial infection in the body, a fever is the body\u2019s way of waging war against it. It\u2019s your immune system\u2019s defense mechanism, that raises your body\u2019s temperature to a point where the germs can\u2019t survive anymore. But remember your body can take the heat!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When you give your child antipyretics to bring their fever down, what happens in turn is that their immune system gradually loses its innate ability to fight off germs naturally. So the truth is &#8211; a fever is more a friend than a foe!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If this is the case, what does one do to recover from a viral infection?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time once again to dive into actual patient stories!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Lisas_Story_A_Great_Holiday_And_Thereafter\">Lisa\u2019s Story: A Great Holiday And Thereafter<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This is the story of 13yr old Angath, who lives in Mumbai, India. It\u2019s about his fever, it\u2019s effects and his mother who refused to pump antipyretics into his system. Here\u2019s his mother, Lisa\u2019s account of what went down.<\/p>\n<p>For his vacation from school, Angath and his family visited their family home in Goa. As most monsoon holidays usually are, this vacation was filled with splashing around in the garden with water, getting drenched in the rain and of course, hours and hours of football in the muck. (What young boy\u2019s rainy holiday is ever complete without it?)<\/p>\n<p>After playtime was over, his sister and he would go home, have a warm shower and be ready for a piping hot meal.<\/p>\n<p>The other highlight, like that of any child\u2019s holiday was &#8211; junk food! Everyday rules never apply on vacation. Right? So the otherwise healthy and cautious Angath loaded up on burgers, chips, ice creams and desserts.<\/p>\n<p>While everything he did may have made him the perfect candidate for a viral, that spreads so easily in the rains, in Goa, he was in perfect health. \u201cBut we were in Goa. There\u2019s just no pollution. he couldn\u2019t have got the virus there, because no one else had it\u201d , said his mother, Lisa.<\/p>\n<p>After a happy and soul satisfying holiday, it was back to the grind in Mumbai. Since it was still vacation time, there was some more fun to be had.<\/p>\n<p>The day after they arrived (a Friday), Angath decided to grab some street food. He immediately knew something was wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going down\u201d, he said.<\/p>\n<p>The next day, he spent the day out of the house. A whole day of football went by, but his water intake was zero. Lisa remembers telling him he needed to hydrate, but mom\u2019s advice is often forgotten when a game of football is underway.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Virus_Attacks\">The Virus Attacks<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19911\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Fever-virus.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19911\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19911\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Fever-virus.webp\" alt=\"How to treat a fever - virus attack\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19911\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to treat a fever &#8211; virus attack<\/p><\/div>\n<p>By Monday, his body seemed to give in.<\/p>\n<p>It began with a headache in the morning. His eyes began to turn red and his headache soon turned into a migraine, something he tended to have often, due to dehydration. The pain radiated to the back of his neck.<\/p>\n<p>At this point Lisa decided it was time for some home remedies to kick in. She started him off with a lime shot and then used rose water on his eyes to help cool them down.<\/p>\n<p>By late afternoon his body temperature began rising, however the fever hadn\u2019t set in yet. As this happened, she gave him a paracetamol to help regulate his temperature, and within a half hour, his eyes cleared. He slept all evening.<\/p>\n<p>On day 2, his fever kept rising. As confirmed by their doctor, the viral had begun, all guns blazing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lisa attributed this to 2 factors:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Virals usually manifest in active bodies. Angath had just finished participating in the swimming nationals. While he trained, he was on a strict diet of soups, salads, almond milk and <em>rotis <\/em>made from <em>sprouted moong flour. <\/em>No wheat, no hidden sugars.<\/li>\n<li>After this strict diet, he let loose in Goa and filled his body with foods it wasn\u2019t used to. Even on his return to Mumbai, the street food just didn\u2019t agree with him. This may have been his body\u2019s way of protesting.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Since her pregnancy, Lisa has been a strong believer of natural treatments for ailments, as far as possible. What disillusioned her with allopathy further was the fact that both her children had been vaccinated against chicken pox and in spite of it, they both had chicken pox.<\/p>\n<p>Based on her naturopath\u2019s advice, her whole family has become accustomed to healthy, natural remedies for ailments and discomfort in their bodies. Even her kids (aged 10 and 13) now know the healing properties of spices like cinnamon, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/immunity\/health-benefits-of-turmeric-and-curcumin\/\">turmeric, and cumin<\/a>. They often ask her for onion shots when their stomach feels upset. They know that a mixture of ginger and honey can be used to raise the body\u2019s temperature when they are cold, and when they feel like they\u2019ve eaten too much junk, they know to ask for a lemon shot. Medicines and allopathic digestives have no place in her home.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Simple_Home_Remedies_For_A_Fever\">Simple Home Remedies For A Fever<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19912\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Herbal-Tea-for-fever.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19912\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19912\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Herbal-Tea-for-fever.webp\" alt=\"How to treat a fever - herbal remedies for fever\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19912\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to treat a fever &#8211; herbal remedies for fever<\/p><\/div>\n<p>So when Angath\u2019s fever began to rear its ugly head, Lisa\u2019s naturopath suggested simple home remedies:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Having tepid water baths, when the fever rises<\/li>\n<li>Putting his feet in a bath with hot water and rock salt, when he\u2019s feeling cold<\/li>\n<li>Placing cool pack on his head and stomach to bring down his temperature<\/li>\n<li>Drinking a herbal tea called <em>\u201cKadha\u201d <\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>[<em>Kadha <\/em>is a popular Indian household remedy for a fever, sore throat and even colds. It is made by adding cumin seeds, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/health-benefits-of-cinnamon\/\">cinnamon<\/a> and ginger to a pot of water and bringing it to a boil. Honey is then added to this, which helps with the fever and breaks acidity]<\/p>\n<p>Despite all these remedies, Lisa still gave paracetamol a chance on Day 1. However, it didn\u2019t seem to help Angath\u2019s fever at all. It fluctuated between 103.3 and 103.7. There seemed to be no point in continuing.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>There was the option of going to the hospital, but Lisa was sure they\u2019d put him onto antibiotics that her son\u2019s body didn\u2019t really need, for a sickness he didn\u2019t really have.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Despite concerns, swine flu was ruled out by the absence of a cold, cough and running to the loo. What Angath was struggling with was not being able to eat anything and keep it down, even boiled food and <em>khichdi. <\/em>He couldn\u2019t eat anything that needed too much digestion, because the stomach was weak and burning up. Instead, he had coconut water, fresh juices and soups that were easy on his stomach.<\/p>\n<p>By the 48th hour, it was all over! He felt better, his fever dropped to 101 and then to 98.6. The natural remedies had paid off, without causing any harm to his body.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Healing_Without_Any_Drugs\">Healing Without Any Drugs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>At the end of this whole ordeal, Lisa was relieved &#8211; both, because her son felt better and because she didn\u2019t have to resort to medication with potential side effects, to help him heal. She says that all it needs on a parent\u2019s part is patience, determination, stamina (lots of it!) and faith in your method.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It\u2019s important to know that even though the effects of these remedies can\u2019t be seen immediately, like with allopathy, these are healing you from within.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Like we always say, allopathy is only the band aid you put from above.
