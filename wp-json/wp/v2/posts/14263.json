Banishing sugar from your diet comes with a plethora of health benefits. While some people like a 3-day or 7-day sugar detox to start with, we highly recommend a 21-day sugar cleanse. Especially if you are dealing with chronic diseases like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/\">diabetes type 2<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/\">PCOS<\/a>, this is the right time to go on a 21-day sugar cleanse to reclaim your health!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Look_Forward_To_These_8_Benefits_of_a_21-Day_Sugar_Cleanse\">Look Forward To These 8 Benefits of a 21-Day Sugar Cleanse<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20545\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/21-Day-Sugar-Cleanse.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20545\" class=\"wp-image-20545 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/21-Day-Sugar-Cleanse.webp\" alt=\"Benefits of a 21-Day Sugar Cleanse\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Benefits of a 21-Day Sugar Cleanse<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"You_Will_Lose_Weight\">You Will Lose Weight<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you are cutting back on sugar for health reasons, weight loss may not be your primary goal. But you surely will lose weight when you remove all types of sugars from your diet! A study found that simply reducing the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages results in weight loss. So imagine what will happen when you cut out all sugars from your diet! You will notice that you start to lose weight around the waist, hips, and thighs. Apart from making you feel good, weight loss will also make you less vulnerable to chronic health conditions like diabetes type 2, PCOS (in women,) GERD, heart disease, hypertension and more.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Improve_Hormonal_Health_In_Women\">Improve Hormonal Health In Women<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2007\/11\/071109171610.htm\">Researchers<\/a> have found that eating too much fructose and glucose can turn off the gene that regulates the levels of active testosterone and estrogen in the body. This can lead to hormonal imbalances. Cutting back on sugar and refined carbohydrates improves insulin sensitivity, which can help correct hormonal imbalances. As a result, giving up sugar will improve menstrual regularity, keep PMS at bay and also prevent bloating.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"You_Will_have_Better_Focus_and_Concentration\">You Will have Better Focus and Concentration<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A diet devoid of simple sugars improves your brain power. Primary <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12088740\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studies<\/a> reveal that refined sugars can influence brain structure and function via regulation of neurotrophins.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"You_Will_Have_More_Energy\">You Will Have More Energy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>One of the best perks of a 21-day Sugar Cleanse is the surge in energy. When you break those sugar cravings and beat that sugar-caused fatigue, you will feel more active, energized and positive. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2551664\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studies<\/a> show that dietary sugars negatively affect orexin cells, which is why we feel tired, fatigued and sluggish after a sugar-rich meal.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_Skin_Will_Be_Better\">Your Skin Will Be Better<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you have suffered from acne and pigmentation, your dermatologist has probably asked you to cut back on sugar. Studies find that a diet high in refined sugars and dairy influences hormonal and inflammatory factors to worsen acne, particularly in women. A sugar detox will help calm irritated skin and also improve your complexion.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_Immunity_Will_Improve\">Your Immunity Will Improve<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Giving up on sugar boosts the immune system, making you less susceptible to infections. A study done in 1973 found that eliminating all added and processed sugar improves blood cell function.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Improved_Gut_Health\">Improved Gut Health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your gut will thank you for cutting down on sugar, because it is detrimental to gut health. Bad gut bacteria feed on sugar. Hence, a diet high in sugars promotes inflammation, bloating, hyperacidity, and can lead to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3448089\/\">gut dysbiosis<\/a>. A diet devoid of sugars greatly improves gut health and encourages a healthy gut microbiome.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Improved_Liver_Health\">Improved Liver Health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Sugar is toxic for the liver, especially the cheaper fructose. This carbohydrate in sucrose doesn\u2019t get absorbed in the gut but goes directly to the liver. It can cause leptin resistance, heart disease, fatty liver, obesity, hepatic insulin resistance, slower metabolism, higher cholesterol, hypertension and even gout. Staying off sugar for 21 days can work wonders for your liver.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Final_Thoughts_21-Day_Sugar_Cleanse\">Final Thoughts: 21-Day Sugar Cleanse<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The aim of a 21-day Sugar Cleanse is to remove all forms of sugar from your diet. This doesn\u2019t just include raw sugar, but also sugars hidden in processed and packaged foods. You should also remove all natural sugars, sweeteners, processed foods, and even very sweet tropical fruits from your diet during this sugar detox.<\/p>\n<p>For a 21-Day sugar cleanse, mental preparedness is vital to your success. Sugar is toxic and giving up all sugar and processed sweets will not be easy.\u00a0The initial 72 hours are the toughest, as your body goes through sugar withdrawal symptoms. Don\u2019t be surprised if you feel anxious, nauseous, very hungry, and have headaches. It gets easier from here on out, we promise! By day 4, your need for a sugar fix will seem less intense, and you can start re-training your taste buds as your old cravings fall away.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that this is not a lifestyle plan, and you don\u2019t have to stick to it for life. This is a short-term cleanse that helps break the addictive cycle of sugar and carb cravings that robs us of our health. Once you\u2019re through, you can reintroduce small quantities of natural sugars for a balanced, healthy diet.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Look Forward To These 8 Benefits of a 21-Day Sugar Cleanse1.1 You Will Lose Weight1.2 Improve Hormonal Health In Women1.3 You Will have Better Focus and Concentration1.4 You Will Have More Energy1.5 Your Skin Will Be Better1.6 Your Immunity Will Improve1.7 Improved Gut Health1.8 Improved Liver Health2 Final Thoughts: 21-Day Sugar Cleanse [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24,"featured_media":20547,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[69],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>21-Day Sugar Cleanse: 8 Reasons To Try It Now | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"If you want a healthier diet and lifestyle, a sugar cleanse is the right place to start.
