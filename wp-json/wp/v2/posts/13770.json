It is widely consumed from breakfast to a quick snack or even a dessert. In spite of its popularity, you\u2019ll hear a lot of people ask: Is banana really healthy? Well, the answer to the question is: Yes, bananas are healthy. Let us take a look at the health benefits of banana.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Reduces_Blood_Pressure\">Reduces Blood Pressure<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Banana is rich in potassium. One of the health benefits of potassium is that it improves heart health, which in turn helps in lowering blood pressure. Studies suggest that having two bananas a day can reduce blood pressure by 10%.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Helps_In_Fighting_Cancer_Cells\">Helps In Fighting Cancer Cells<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Did you know that a fully ripe banana with dark patches has anti-cancer properties? Yes, a Japanese study has confirmed that riper the banana is, the greater the amount of TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) it has. \u00a0TNF helps the body in fighting cancer cells. Ripe bananas are eight times more effective than green ones, because they increase white blood cells in the body, which in turn help in fighting off cancer cells.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Boosts_Immunity\">Boosts Immunity<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Our immune system fights against viruses &amp; bacteria. It is extremely important to have a strong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/immunity\/immune-system-boosters\/\">immune <\/a>system. The high concentration of tryptophan (an essential amino acid) in banana results in a calming effect.Also, banana is rich in nutrients like vitamin B6. The daily recommended dose of Vitamin B6 is 30%, which helps in making proteins for the immune system. Vitamin B6 also helps the body\u2019s nervous system and boosts metabolism.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Fights_Acid_Reflux\">Fights Acid Reflux<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As soon as the food passes the LES (lower esophageal sphincter), it is closed. However, if the LES doesn\u2019t close properly then the acid which is produced in the stomach moves back to the esophagus. This causes an irritation on the esophagus lining, which in turn causes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/foods-fight-acid-reflux\/\">acid reflux<\/a>. The alkaline properties of this humble fruit help in balancing stomach acid. The minerals, vitamins (especially vitamin B6) and fibers present in bananas also help in strengthening the esophagus. \u00a0This fibrous fruit also helps in\u00a0eliminating harmful toxins in the stomach.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Reduces_The_Risk_Of_Asthma\">Reduces The Risk Of Asthma<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Asthma is an allergy-triggered disease, and a lot of people get it at an early age. \u00a0A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nutraingredients-usa.com\/Research\/Apple-juice-bananas-may-lower-childhood-asthma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study <\/a>found that children who consumed just one banana per day had fewer chances of developing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/asthma\/6-popular-ayurvedic-herbs-treating-asthma\/\">asthma <\/a>by almost 34%. That\u2019s why it is said, \u201ca banana a day keeps asthma away.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Promotes_Heart_Health\">Promotes Heart Health<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Patients who suffer from heart disease are often told to increase their potassium intake. Potassium is known to lower the chances of stroke and protect the loss of muscle mass (the heart is also a muscle.) Bananas are rich in potassium, and thus very good for heart health.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Improves_Vision\">Improves Vision<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>All of us have heard: \u201cEat carrots if you want to improve your vision.\u201d But studies now claim that banana can help in improving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/eyesight\/how-to-improve-eyesight-naturally\/\">vision <\/a>too. Vitamin A plays an important role in eye health. The vitamin A present in banana plays an important role in protecting your eye membranes. Vitamin A also helps in protecting the surface of your cornea.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Reduces Blood Pressure2 Helps In Fighting Cancer Cells3 Boosts Immunity4 Fights Acid Reflux5 Reduces The Risk Of Asthma6 Promotes Heart Health7 Improves Vision Banana is one of the most popular fruits, which is loved by both kids and adults.
