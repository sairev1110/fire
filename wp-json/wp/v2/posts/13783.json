The tips I am about to share with you are things I have learnt from Dr.Tom Cowan. Dr. Cowan is a cardiologist who understands diseases and healing the way few physicians do.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Heart_Health_Tip_1_Eat_The_Healthiest_Organic_Food_Rich_In_Saturated_Fats\">Heart Health Tip 1: Eat The Healthiest Organic Food, Rich In Saturated Fats<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This would sound like a no-brainer, but I\u2019ve chosen my words carefully. For one, we all earn our living to enjoy our lives and to do that, we have to first be in good health. And yet, we don\u2019t like to spend money to buy the healthiest food we can. We need to make a little extra effort, to find the organic, real food and pay a little extra to source it. Second, for too long we have been told that cholesterol is bad for the heart, butter is bad for the arteries, ghee is bad for our health. Nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/saturated-fat-good-for-you\/\">saturated fats<\/a> is our best friend. The heart thrives on ketones \u2013 chemicals that are produced from good fats. So getting a healthy, organic, saturated fat-rich diet is vital for heart health.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Heart_Health_Tip_2_Drink_The_Cleanest_Mineral_Rich_Water\">Heart Health Tip 2: Drink The Cleanest, Mineral Rich Water<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Again, am I making an obvious, meaningless recommendation? I don\u2019t think so. Clean water means not just free of microbes and heavy metals but also water that is rich in minerals. You can add back minerals to your water supply inexpensively. It will take some effort to test your water supply and figure out what it\u2019s missing, but it will pay you back over a lifetime of health. Dr.Pollock at Washington University has found that structured water, which is basically water that has the ability to flow better, can help prevent arterial damage. You can create this water at home, by simply passing your drinking water through glass beads or a funnel that creates a vortex to restore<\/p>\n<p>Dr.Pollock at Washington University has found that structured water, which is basically water that has the ability to flow better, can help prevent arterial damage. You can create this water at home, by simply passing your drinking water through glass beads or a funnel that creates a vortex to restore structure to water. Storing it in a copper vessel is a trick that Ayurveda recommends to structure the water.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Heart_Health8217s_Tip_3_Ground_Yourself_30-90_Minutes_A_Day\">Heart Health&#8217;s Tip 3: Ground Yourself 30-90 Minutes A Day<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>By just coming in contact with the earth, you get free electrons from it. These electrons act like antioxidants, neutralizing the ill effects of stress and chemical pollutants, helping our blood flow properly again.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Heart_Health8217s_Tip_4_Get_At_Least_8_Hugs_A_Day\">Heart Health&#8217;s Tip 4: Get At Least 8 Hugs A Day<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>For this tip, I\u2019m combining advice from Dr.Cowan with advice from another of my teachers, Dr.John Nieters, Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental medicine in Alameda, California. In his book Human Heart, Cosmic Heart, Dr.Cowan shows that love and contact with fellow human beings and pets\u00a0 help to rejuvenate the parasympathetic nervous system. Research shows that it is under-stimulation of this relaxing part of the nervous system that pushes us over the edge and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/heart-attacks-happen\/\">causes heart attacks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s the round up. It\u2019s what our ancestors have done for ages, naturally. Start implementing these four heart health tips, even one at a time in your life, and watch your heart get healthier and life change for the better. Wish you vibrant health and well being!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Heart Health Tip 1: Eat The Healthiest Organic Food, Rich In Saturated Fats2 Heart Health Tip 2: Drink The Cleanest, Mineral Rich Water3 Heart Health&#8217;s Tip 3: Ground Yourself 30-90 Minutes A Day4 Heart Health&#8217;s Tip 4: Get At Least 8 Hugs A Day Before I share the 4 most important heart [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":20334,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[106],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>4 Most Important Heart Health Tips To Remember | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Did you know that getting 8 hugs a day is good for your heart?
