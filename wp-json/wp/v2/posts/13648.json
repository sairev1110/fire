The research is very clear on them &#8212; they can treat, prevent and even reverse a variety of chronic ailments like Obesity, Diabetes Type 2, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/\">PCOS<\/a>, and Metabolic Syndrome, to name just a few.<\/p>\n<p>That said; there seems to be a lot of dogma concerning low carb diets, particularly the LCHF or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/low-carb-high-fat-lchf-diet-diabetes\/\">Low Carb-High Fat<\/a> diet. LCHF can sometimes get flak for being impractical, restrictive, unsustainable, unhealthy in the long run, and much more. Now, I can imagine all the thoughts going through your head. All those arguments that prove LCHF is not sustainable and could actually do your body harm in the long run, right? Time to bust some of those Low-Carb High-Fat Myths!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"8_Myths_About_Low-Carb_High-Fat_Diets_You_Shouldn8217t_Believe\">8 Myths About Low-Carb High-Fat Diets You Shouldn&#8217;t Believe<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Myth_1_You_Will_Completely_Eliminate_Carbs_From_Your_Diet\">Myth #1: You Will Completely Eliminate Carbs From Your Diet<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Truth:<\/strong>\u00a0LCHF is different from a Keto or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/ketogenic-diet-low-carb-high-fat-lchf-diet\/\">Ketogenic diet<\/a>, though the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. LCHF stands for Low Carb-High Fat; not \u2018No Carbs\u2019. You can still eat carbs (from good sources, though) as long as you keep it below 100gm per day. The lower the better. Carbs from fiber-rich vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts, and dairy are all allowed.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Myth_2_You_Will_Eat_Far_Too_Many_Animal_Proteins\">Myth #2: You Will Eat Far Too Many Animal Proteins<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Truth:<\/strong>\u00a0An LCHF diet is not a high-protein diet. Thus, it\u2019s suitable for everyone, irrespective of their activity levels. You eat moderate amounts of proteins from organic, lean cuts of meats. There aren\u2019t any excess proteins here to affect kidney and liver health.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Myth_3_You_Will_Miss_Out_On_Nutrition\">Myth #3: You Will Miss Out On Nutrition<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Truth:<\/strong> LCHF diet is varied, and includes a complete range of whole foods. In fact, it\u2019s a lot less restrictive than other diets. Because all it essentially cuts out from your diet is processed foods and refined carbohydrates like white bread, pasta and rice.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Myth_4_Your_Diet_Will_Be_Severely_Restricted\">Myth #4: Your Diet Will Be Severely Restricted<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Truth:<\/strong> LCHF is not more restrictive than most healthy diets. Yes, it asks you to cut out a lot of products. But these are all essentially processed foods loaded with hidden sugars and inflammation-causing refined grains. You may not be able to fill up your shopping cart with a bunch of ready-to-eat food packets. But you are free to fill it up with fresh vegetables, fruits, meat, nuts, seeds and dairy products. Don\u2019t put a tag on your diet if you don\u2019t like it. But as soon as you cut out processed foods in your diet, it automatically becomes Low-Carb High-Fat Myths.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Myth_5_All_Those_Fats_Will_Increase_Your_Risk_To_Cardiovascular_Disease\">Myth #5: All Those Fats Will Increase Your Risk To Cardiovascular Disease<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Truth:<\/strong> Eating a high-fat diet will not make you susceptible to heart diseases. In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/annals.org\/aim\/article\/1900694\/effects-low-carbohydrate-low-fat-diets-randomized-trial\">scientists<\/a> found that a low-carbohydrate diet is more effective for weight loss and heart risk factor reduction than a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/is-low-fat-food-good-for-you\/\">low-fat diet<\/a>. According to them, restricting carbohydrate may be a better option for those seeking to lose weight and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Research has found no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. On the other hand, reducing your carbs leads to lower levels of triglycerides, blood pressure, and LDL, while HDL improves.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Myth_6_You_Will_Feel_Tired_All_The_Time_Without_Carbs\">Myth #6: You Will Feel Tired All The Time Without Carbs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Truth:<\/strong> Eating fewer carbs doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll feel tired all the time. Yes, glucose gets converted into energy, but we often eat far too many carbs. And most of the excess gets converted into body fat. On the other hand, dietary fat is a more sustainable fuel for our body than carbs. In fact, eating LCHF ensures you feel more energetic (<em>goodbye <\/em><em>sugar roller coaster rides!<\/em>) and don\u2019t have to worry about afternoon slumps.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Myth_7_Your_Diet_Will_Be_Lacking_In_Essential_Dietary_Fiber\">Myth #7: Your Diet Will Be Lacking In Essential Dietary Fiber<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Truth:<\/strong> Giving up processed and refined grains doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get enough fiber. Because you know what has more fiber than processed grains &#8212;- Whole Foods!!! You still get plenty of fiber on LCHF from all the right sources \u2013 leafy greens, seasonal vegetables, fruits eaten with their skin, nuts, seeds, and coconut.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Myth_8_LCHF_Diet_Is_Not_Sustainable\">Myth #8: LCHF Diet Is Not Sustainable<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Truth:<\/strong> LCHF is not a \u201cDiet\u201d but a \u201cLifestyle\u201d, and that means it\u2019s very much sustainable for life. You can read our tips on how to make LCHF sustainable and be the judge. Finally, \u00a0even if you follow the stricter Keto diet (carbohydrate intake restricted to 20-30gm\/day) for a limited amount of time to treat health conditions like Obesity, PCOS, Prediabetes or Diabetes Type 2, it\u2019s easier to transition to LCHF once you\u2019ve reached your goals. LCHF is a clean, healthy way to eat for life.<\/p>\n<p>However, we want to add that LCHF diet may not be the best choice for everyone. Some people really need to eat more carbohydrates for optimal function. But for those who can achieve incredible life-saving benefits of\u00a0eating Low Carb-High Fat, let\u2019s not distort the facts. It\u2019s best to always discuss any dietary changes with your healthcare provider to know if it\u2019s safe and will work for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 8 Myths About Low-Carb High-Fat Diets You Shouldn&#8217;t Believe1.1 Myth #1: You Will Completely Eliminate Carbs From Your Diet1.2 Myth #2: You Will Eat Far Too Many Animal Proteins1.3 Myth #3: You Will Miss Out On Nutrition1.4 Myth #4: Your Diet Will Be Severely Restricted1.5 Myth #5: All Those Fats Will Increase [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24,"featured_media":20272,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[69],"tags":[93,94],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>8 Low-Carb High-Fat Myths You Should Ignore | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Low-Carb High-Fat Myths can prevent and even reverse conditions like diabetes and PCOS.
