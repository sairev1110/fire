And while people often use these diet terms interchangeably, there are key differences and things to note about each diet before choosing which one works best for you.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_a_Low-Carb_High-Fat_LCHF_Diet\">What is a Low-Carb High-Fat (LCHF) Diet?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There is no concrete definition of a low-carb, high-fat diet. In essence, it\u2019s any meal plan that follows the philosophies of the diet\u2019s name itself.<\/p>\n<p>Example low-carb, high-fat diets include the Atkins Diet, created in the 1950s, and the South Beach Diet, which rose to fame in 2003.<\/p>\n<p>In the former, which was created by Dr. Robert Coleman Atkins, you go through several dietary phases. In the first phase, you eat approximately 30 grams of carbohydrates a day, along with unlimited fat and protein.<\/p>\n<p>In the latter, which was created by cardiologist Arthur Agatston, you eat a modified low-carb diet. In the beginning, approximately 45% of your calories come from carbs, but by the final phase, only 28% of your daily calories are derived from carbs. The bulk of your remaining calories are supposed to come from healthy fats and protein.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, there\u2019s significant wiggle room in terms of what can be defined as a low-carb, high-fat diet.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_a_Ketogenic_Diet\">What is a Ketogenic Diet?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>On the other hand, a ketogenic diet comes with much stricter parameters. It was created in the early 1900s by Dr. Russell Wilder. A true ketogenic diet allows just 5% of your daily calories to come from carbohydrates. The rest of your calories should come from fats (75% of your daily calories) and protein (20% of your daily calories).<\/p>\n<p>As its name suggests, the focus of this style of eating is on ketone bodies. When followed strictly, the idea is that your body shifts into a constant state of nutritional ketosis.<\/p>\n<p>On such an ultra-low carb meal plan, your liver breaks the fat you eat into ketone bodies and fatty acids. The proponents of this diet say that by eating a ketogenic diet, you force your system to use ketone bodies as energy.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Does_the_Science_Say\">What Does the Science Say?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Because of the shifting definitions of a low-carb diet, clear research results are difficult to come by. However, there are some studies that suggest using fat for fuel (as one would do when on a ketogenic diet) could bring with it some benefits.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a 2015 study published in the European Journal of Sport Science notes that &#8220;keto-adaptation&#8221; (using fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates) &#8220;could extend human physical and mental performance beyond current expectation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This supports older research, such as one published in the Metabolism research journal in the 1980s, that suggested the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>Other benefits pushed by supporters of the ketogenic diet philosophy include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved body fat composition. The idea is that by encouraging your body to see fat as fuel, you ramp up how your body burns its own fat.<\/li>\n<li>Better blood sugar levels. The theory is that by restricting your intake of carbohydrates, you avoid the constant blood sugar spikes that occur whenever you eat carbs.<\/li>\n<li>Improved brain health. Supporters of high-fat diets point out that your brain uses fat for energy, and the theory is that higher dietary fat intake can improve your mental performance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Which_Diet_is_Right_For_You\">Which Diet is Right For You?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The right diet for you depends on your goals, your lifestyle, and factors like your age and gender.<\/p>\n<p>For example, for diabetics, we strongly endorse the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/low-carb-high-fat-lchf-diet-diabetes\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">Low Carb High Fat (LCHF)<\/a> diet for reversing the condition.<\/p>\n<p>Some women find that an extremely low-carb approach to meals can negatively impact their menstruation cycles. Other people find that following a ketogenic meal plan makes them feel fatigued and sluggish. For these reasons, always talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian if you\u2019re considering any changes to your diet.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ketogenicsupplementreviews.com\/ketosis-diet\/hacks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beginner<\/a>, be sure to do your research, understand how a keto diet might impact your health, stock your pantry\u00a0 and be mentally prepared to handle the keto life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 What is a Low-Carb High-Fat (LCHF) Diet?2 What is a Ketogenic Diet?3 What Does the Science Say?4 Which Diet is Right For You? \u201cLow carb diet\u201d and \u201cketo diet\u201d are terms that get casually thrown around in conversations.
