The aches and pains that come with arthritis can be a challenge to live with, and your diet may be partly to blame! This is why we highly recommend an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/arthritis\/suffering-from-arthritis-its-time-to-adopt-the-anti-inflammatory-diet\/\">anti-inflammatory diet<\/a> for anyone suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.<\/p>\n<p>An autoimmune disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis or RA causes the body\u2019s immune system to mistakenly attack normal, healthy cells. This causes inflammation in the synovium (the tissue that lines the inside of joints) leading to thickening of the tissue to eventually destroy the cartilage and bone that make up the joints over time. So you see, inflammation is at the heart of RA, and a diet that helps fight inflammation may be your best bet to beat joint pain.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"12_Inflammatory_Foods_To_Avoid_With_Rheumatoid_Arthritis\">12 Inflammatory Foods To Avoid With Rheumatoid Arthritis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>We are what we eat. And some foods may worsen the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis, leading to increased joint pain. As a part of a healthy RA management strategy, we recommend you avoid eating these foods completely.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Red_Meat\">Red Meat<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19809\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Red-Meat.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19809\" class=\"wp-image-19809 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Red-Meat.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19809\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Red Meat<\/p><\/div>\n<p>A study done at Department of Food Science and Technology, University of California, found correlations between the consumption of red meat and\/or processed meat and rheumatoid arthritis, along with type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2018s disease and certain types of cancers. High in saturated fats, red meat triggers an inflammatory response in the body, which can increase swelling and pain in joints. In fact, many patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis find that their symptoms drastically improve when they give up red meat and shift to plant-based proteins like beans, legumes and soy.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Processed_Foods\">Processed Foods<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19812\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Processed-Foods.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19812\" class=\"wp-image-19812 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Processed-Foods.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19812\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Processed Foods<\/p><\/div>\n<p>If food comes out of a packet, it has no business sitting on your plate! Ready-to-eat, packaged foods and snacks lack wholesome nutrition. Filled with additives, fillers, sugars and preservatives to increase their shelf-life, these foods aid inflammation and are far from healthy. If you\u2019re going to make just one change in your diet with RA, give up all processed foods and instead choose whole, nutrient-dense REAL foods.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Fried_Foods\">Fried Foods<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19813\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Fried-Foods.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19813\" class=\"wp-image-19813 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Fried-Foods.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19813\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fried Foods<\/p><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s time to give up on Crispy Fried Chicken and French fries! Not only do fried foods lead to obesity, frying to foods leads to formation of Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) &#8212; harmful compounds that are linked to oxidative stress and inflammation. According to a study done at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, dietary AGEs may play an important role in the causation of chronic diseases associated with underlying inflammation.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Refined_Carbs_and_Sugars\">Refined Carbs and Sugars<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19814\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Refined-Carbs-and-Sugars.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19814\" class=\"wp-image-19814 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Refined-Carbs-and-Sugars.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19814\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Refined Carbs and Sugars<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Not only are refined carbs and sugars extremely unhealthy, they cause a sugar-spike which produces pro-inflammatory chemicals known as cytokines. And you\u2019re right &#8212; these will worsen your rheumatoid arthritis joint pain and cause further inflammation. Also, these calorie-dense foods will make you pack on more pounds, which will exert further stress on your joints. Give up all refined carbs and sugary treats.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Excess_Salt\">Excess Salt<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19815\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Excess-Salt.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19815\" class=\"wp-image-19815 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Excess-Salt.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19815\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Excess Salt<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Do you love to add extra salt on your eggs and veggies?

When you have RA, your immune system is already skewed and may identify MSG and other artificially-made food additives as foreign bodies, going into \u2018attack\u2019 mode that will lead to further inflammation.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Gluten\">Gluten<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19817\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Gluten.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19817\" class=\"wp-image-19817 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Gluten.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19817\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gluten<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Researchers now believe that rheumatoid arthritis shares genetic overlap with other autoimmune disease. As such, it may be linked to celiac disease, which is why if you suffer from RA, its best to cut back on gluten. Found in wheat, rye, and barley, gluten is a complex protein that is hard to digest and may contribute to inflammation.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Diet_Soda\">Diet Soda<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19818\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Diet-Soda.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19818\" class=\"wp-image-19818 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Diet-Soda.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19818\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diet Soda<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Diet soda is high in aspartame which triggers inflammatory responses, especially in people who are already suffering from an inflammatory disease with rheumatoid arthritis.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Alcohol_and_Tobacco\">Alcohol and Tobacco<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19820\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Alcohol-and-Tobacco.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19820\" class=\"wp-image-19820 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Alcohol-and-Tobacco.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19820\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alcohol and Tobacco<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Firstly, alcohol is not recommended for anyone who takes pain medication. And if you have rheumatoid arthritis, chances are that you are on these very medications! Besides the dangers of mixing alcohol with pain pills, alcohol also promotes low-grade inflammation. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/iji\/2015\/439396\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studies<\/a> have also found that IL-6 or interleukin-6 (a pro-inflammatory marker) levels were significantly associated with smoking especially among current smokers. It\u2019s time to quit smoking. And if you do drink, do so only occasionally.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dairy\">Dairy<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19821\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Dairy.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19821\" class=\"wp-image-19821 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Dairy.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19821\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dairy<\/p><\/div>\n<p>For some, symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may flare up in response to casein, a protein found in milk. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Linda_Merlino\/publication\/8912957_Vitamin_D_Intake_Is_Inversely_Associated_With_Rheumatoid_Arthritis_Results_From_the_Iowa_Women's_Health_Study\/links\/0046351473b277a650000000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research<\/a> has also shown that vitamin D (a key nutrient in dairy products) intake is adversely linked with rheumatoid arthritis. It\u2019s not uncommon for patients suffering from RA to also be lactose intolerant. We recommend you cut out all dairy products from your diet to see if it brings about any improvements in your RA symptoms. Ayurveda also recommends avoiding yogurt if you have rheumatoid arthritis.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Unhealthy_Fats\">Unhealthy Fats<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19822\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Unhealthy-Fats.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19822\" class=\"wp-image-19822 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Unhealthy-Fats.webp\" alt=\"Foods to Avoid with Rheumatoid Arthritis\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19822\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unhealthy Fats<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Avoid all trans fats, saturated fats and hydrogenated oils.

Not only do these lead to an imbalanced omega 6 to omega 3 ratio in the body, these trigger inflammatory responses that add to your RA pain. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0049017297800091\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research done at Royal Adelaide Hospital, South Australia<\/a> found potential for complementarity between drug therapy and dietary choices that increase intake of omega 3 fats and decrease intake of omega 6 fats. In particular, there is the potential for drug-sparing effects.<\/p>\n<p>Polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as grape seed, cottonseed, safflower, corn and sunflower oils are best avoided. Instead, use extra virgin olive oil, flaxseed oil, cod liver oil or macadamia oil &#8211; rich in omega 3\u2019s and also oleic acid, a heart-healthy, monounsaturated fatty acid. <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/art.1780330607\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studies<\/a> have found that dietary fish oil and olive oil supplementation in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis produced beneficial immunologic effects.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s best to cut back on saturated fats when you have rheumatoid arthritis. As for trans fats, avoid them completely, as they promote inflammation.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Diet_Is_Recommended_For_Rheumatoid_Arthritis\">What Diet Is Recommended For Rheumatoid Arthritis?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The Mediterranean Diet approach is often considered the best option for those with RA because it increases the levels of nutrients that reduce the inflammatory activity of the immune system.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00296-002-0234-7?LI=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">German research study<\/a> found that a diet low in arachidonic acid, or a vegetarian diet, improves inflammation in patients with RA and augments the beneficial effect of fish oil supplementation. Another <a href=\"http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/content\/62\/3\/208.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">experimental study<\/a> of a Mediterranean diet intervention for patients with rheumatoid arthritis found that patients with RA, by adjusting to a Mediterranean diet, did obtain a reduction in inflammatory activity, an increase in physical function, and improved vitality.<\/p>\n<p>So go ahead, revamp your diet to avoid these inflammation-triggering foods and you may just lessen your dependence on pain medication!
