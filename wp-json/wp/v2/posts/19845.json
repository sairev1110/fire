Here are a few facts about infertility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>25% of infertile couples have various factors contributing to the condition.<\/li><li>Irregular or abnormal ovulation accounts for approximately 25% of all female infertility problems.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Go through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/fertility\/fertility-and-how-it-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this detailed guide on Fertility 101<\/a> to understand just how fertility works in women. Keep reading to know what fertility tests you might need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Fertility_tests_for_women\">Fertility tests for women<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Infertility-Tests.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-20053\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>For women, fertility testing starts with a basic gynecological exam. Your doctor might need details like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Information about your lifestyle, work, and home environment<\/li><li>Your medical and surgical history<\/li><li>Use of birth control<\/li><li>Your menstrual history<\/li><li>Information about your sexual practices<\/li><li>Pregnancy history if any<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The physician will also conduct a thorough physical check-up. They will look at your thyroid, breasts, hair growth, and pelvic area. They may also conduct a pap smear test (which involves collecting cells from your cervix &#8211; the lower, narrow end of your uterus that&#8217;s at the top of your vagina &#8211; to test for cervical cancer). They may also test for STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) if needed.<br><br>Next, the doctor might want to start with some early tests. Most of these are around ovulation. Many women track their menstrual and ovulation cycles currently, using specific apps or even a fertility monitor.<br><br>Whether you are planning a pregnancy or having trouble conceiving, and have already started tracking your cycles, ovulation, luteal phases, etc., the information can be valuable for your fertility testing. Usually, one of the first questions regarding female fertility is whether you are ovulating or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Ovulation_testing_can_be_divided_into_4_main_types\">Ovulation testing can be divided into 4 main types:<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"1nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp_Ovulation_testing\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ovulation testing<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Ovulation-testing-300x300-2.webp\" alt=\"Ovulation testing\" class=\"wp-image-20152\"\/><figcaption>Ovulation testing<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Women need to \u201covulate\u201d or release an egg to get pregnant. Most gynecologists will need to confirm that you are ovulating and to determine at what point in the period this happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your doctor may ask you to take a urine strip test at home for luteinizing hormone, or LH. This hormone shows up in high levels just before you ovulate.<\/li><li>They may check levels of the hormone progesterone in your blood. A healthy increase in your progesterone level, done around Day-21 of a 28-30 day cycle shows that you are ovulating.<\/li><li>In a healthy cycle, a rise in progesterone levels after ovulation leads to a slight increase in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology\/basal-body-temperature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">base body temperature (BBT)<\/a>. By checking it each morning, you&#8217;ll learn your pattern of ovulation over several months.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your doctor may also run tests on your thyroid, or check for other hormonal problems, to rule out conditions that might cause missed or irregular ovulation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"2nbspnbspnbspnbspnbsp_Ovarian_function_tests\">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ovarian function tests<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"199\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/AMH-300x199-2.webp\" alt=\"Ovarian function tests\" class=\"wp-image-20153\"\/><figcaption>Ovarian function tests<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several tests that can help show a woman\u2019s fertility potential, also called ovarian reserve or Ovarian Function tests.

Blood tests can be done to check this at any time during the menstrual cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4><em>Antral follicle count (ultrasound):<\/em><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A vaginal ultrasound might be done in the early part of your menstrual cycle to check the number of immature follicles in the ovary. These small follicles or antral follicles are where your eggs develop. It is possible to determine how many eggs are available for maturation, by checking the number of antral follicles.<br><br>No single ovulation test can predict a woman\u2019s ability to get pregnant. These tests are often used to develop a treatment plan.

Depending on your specific case, your doctor might ask you to do certain procedures and tests to check these organs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You might be asked to get a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) or a &#8220;tubogram.\u201d This is a series of X-rays of your fallopian tubes and uterus. The X-rays are taken after your doctor injects liquid dye through the vagina. Another method uses saline and air instead of dye and an ultrasound. The HSG helps in determining if there are any blockages in your fallopian tubes or if the uterus has any problems. The test is normally done just after your menstrual period.&nbsp;<\/li><li>You might need to get a transvaginal ultrasound. Using sound waves, they&#8217;ll be able to see images of the ovaries and uterus to check for problems there.<\/li><li>Your doctor might recommend a hysteroscopy. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera through your cervix into your uterus. It helps the doctor see any defects and even take tissue samples if necessary.<\/li><li>You might be asked to do a laparoscopy. This is a surgery where the doctor makes a cut into your belly and inserts tools as well as a camera to check for any potential problems in the abdominal area beyond the uterus and correct them if needed.<\/li><li>Finally, PCT or post-coital testing may be carried out for both males and females. This involves testing cervical mucus few minutes after intercourse.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that your doctor might ask you to do any of these procedures if needed, to check for and correct any major issues affecting your fertility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To know more about couple or at-home fertility tests, click here.&lt;hyperlink&gt;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To know more about male fertility testing, click here.&lt;hyperlink&gt;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_next_after_fertility_testing\">What next after fertility testing?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once fertility testing is done, go back to your doctor (gynecologist, endocrinologist, urologist, etc.) and discuss the results.<br><br>But keep in mind that even if these test results come up as &#8220;normal\u201d, if you are still struggling to conceive, it\u2019s possible that there are foundational issues at the core of your fertility problems.<br><br>Your gut, liver, thyroid hormone, digestive system, sleep, stress, lifestyle &#8211; all these collaborate to help you produce a new life inside you.<br><br>Reproductive system experts like gynecologists and IVF doctors often do not pay attention to your health foundations like diet, vitamin deficiencies, etc. By testing the foundational aspects of your health \u2013 blood sugar, protein absorption, inflammation and even hidden thyroid issues, functional medicine experts are able to identify causes of infertility that lie outside the reproductive system.<br><br>At the Sepalika Fertility program, this is exactly what we do \u2013 identify the root cause of infertility and correct it. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/programs\/fertility-program\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here<\/a> to know more and head over to Sepalika\u2019s fertility program to improve your fertility naturally.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Introduction2 Overview3 Fertility tests for women4 Ovulation testing can be divided into 4 main types:4.1 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ovulation testing4.2 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ovarian function tests4.3 3.
