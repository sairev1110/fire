At the start of the study, none of these people had any heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>What was unique about the study was that it was the first to track the impact of dance had on reducing the risk of death from heart disease. The results? I feel we need a drum roll for this\u2026those who danced regularly had a whopping 46 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death over a decade compared to those who rarely or never danced!<\/p>\n<p>46%? That\u2019s literally halving your risk of death from heart disease. Isn&#8217;t that amazing?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"3_Big_Reasons_Dance_Works_As_A_Heart_Health_Exercise\">3 Big Reasons Dance Works As A Heart Health Exercise<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Dance_is_a_fantastic_aerobic_workout_for_the_heart\">Dance is a fantastic aerobic workout for the heart!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This should be fairly obvious, but the study found that the best results came to people who were at least slightly out of breath or sweaty while dancing. Those who were doing gentle waltzes did not get the same benefit. Several traditional folk dances mimic the fast-slow mixed tempo of interval workouts. So researchers said that is another way to use it as a heart health exercise.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dance_is_an_amazing_stress_buster\">Dance is an amazing stress buster!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Researchers from the University of Sydney said and I quote &#8211; \u201cthe playful social interaction aspects of dancing which, when coupled with some more intense movement, can be a very powerful stress relief and heart health promoting pastime.\u201d That\u2019s basically scientist language for \u2013 It\u2019s Great Fun! Remember \u2013 as we have said earlier at Sepalika \u2013 heart attacks happen, not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/what-causes-heart-attack\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">because of clogged arteries<\/a>, but because the heart is unable to de-stress and relax. What better way to fix this than to dance your worries away?&#8217;<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dance_is_for_life\">Dance is for life!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Dance is addictive, so dancers are often dancers for life. From a heart health point exercise of view, this simply means that dancers don\u2019t drop in and out as much as people in regular exercise classes do. We\u2019ve all paid for annual gym memberships and dropped off within the first month, yes? Instead, if you\u2019re naturally smiling and having fun, you don\u2019t want to stop! Makes sense, right?<\/p>\n<p>So go ahead. Dance those worries away and give your heart the loving, rhythmic massage that it so badly needs. Wish you all fantastic health and well being.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 3 Big Reasons Dance Works As A Heart Health Exercise1.1 Dance is a fantastic aerobic workout for the heart!1.2 Dance is an amazing stress buster!1.3 Dance is for life!
