While the drug has been used for more than three decades for PCOS, it comes with certain side effects.<\/strong> &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A major embarrassing symptom of PCOS is \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-hirsutism\/\">hirsutism<\/a>,\u201d or the sprouting of hair on the face, chest, and stomach. Excess hair growth in&nbsp;PCOS patients is a result of the high levels of male hormones (androgens) in them. For this reason, the pattern of hair growth is similar to that seen in men. Androgens also cause <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-acne\/\">acne<\/a>. Doctors often prescribe a drug called spironolactone for the treatment for hirsutism in PCOS.<\/p>\n<p>Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a \u201cwater pill,\u201d or diuretic that is usually used to reduce swelling due to excess fluid buildup. It is prescribed for diseases like liver cirrhosis, congestive heart failure and nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder). This drug also has an androgen-lowering effect on the body, and hence it is prescribed for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-symptoms\/\">PCOS symptoms <\/a>like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-acne\/\">acne <\/a>and hirsutism.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Spironolactone_Helps_Treat_PCOS_Hirsutism_and_Acne\">How Spironolactone Helps Treat PCOS Hirsutism and Acne?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The effectiveness of spironolactone to treat moderate to severe hirsutism was reported in 1982. Positive effects were seen within two months of treatment. In 1986, a study was done to assess the efficacy of spironolactone in the treatment of acne in women with PCOS. Spironolactone was found to significantly improve acne by reducing the levels of male hormones.<\/p>\n<p>Spironolactone acts by blocking testosterone receptors as well decreasing the production of testosterone. The drug is a potent antagonist (blocker) of the androgen receptor. It does not allow effective binding of molecules of testosterone to its receptor, and thus stops testosterone from showing its effects on the cells.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Side_Effects_of_Spironolactone\">Side Effects of Spironolactone<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20397\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Migraine-and-AR-Header.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20397\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20397\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Migraine-and-AR-Header.webp\" alt=\"Side Effects of Spironolactone\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\"><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Side Effects of Spironolactone<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Spironolactone causes side effects that can range from minor ones like headaches to serious complications like stomach bleeding.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Common_Side_Effects_of_Spironolactone\">Common Side Effects of Spironolactone<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mild nausea or vomiting<\/li>\n<li>Diarrhea<\/li>\n<li>Swelling or tenderness in the breast<\/li>\n<li>Dizziness<\/li>\n<li>Headaches<\/li>\n<li>Mild drowsiness<\/li>\n<li>Cramping in the legs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Other_Serious_Side_Effects_of_Spironolactone_Use\">Other Serious Side Effects of Spironolactone Use<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Stomach bleeding with signs like bloody or tar black-colored stools, coughing up blood or vomit resembling ground-coffee<\/li>\n<li>High potassium levels.

A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12219252\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long term study<\/a> was done to assess the safety of spironolactone. This study found that there were no serious illnesses or health complications that could be attributed to spironolactone use. Apparently, long-term use of spironolactone is safe. Side effects as mentioned above are a problem but they will disappear once you stop using spironolactone.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Precautions_While_Taking_Spironolactone\">Precautions While Taking Spironolactone<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. You shouldn\u2019t be taking this medicine if you are allergic to it or suffer from kidney disease, Addison\u2019s disease (a disorder of the adrenal glands), have high levels of potassium in your body, or are taking a drug called eplerenone.<\/p>\n<p>You should consult with your doctor about the safety of spironolactone if you have a liver or heart disease or an electrolyte imbalance. You should not be taking this medication if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or if you are breast feeding a child.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Does_Spironolactone_Interact_With_Other_Drugs\">Does Spironolactone Interact With Other Drugs?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Spironolactone interacts severely with drugs that weaken the immune system, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus. When taken together, they will cause a sudden increase in potassium levels. Spironolactone also reacts seriously with the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aldosterone receptor agonists (used for congestive heart failure)<\/li>\n<li>Trimethoprim (an antibiotic used to treat bladder infections)<\/li>\n<li>Mitotane (used for treating adrenocortical carcinoma \u2013 a type of cancer \u2013 and Cushing\u2019s syndrome \u2013 a condition caused by high cortisol levels for a long time)<\/li>\n<li>Sodium phosphate bowel cleanser (to clean the bowel before a medical procedure)<\/li>\n<li>Potassium preps (to clean the bowel before a medical procedure)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Other drugs that interact moderately with spironolactone are<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eplerenone<\/li>\n<li>NSAIDs<\/li>\n<li>Antihypertensives<\/li>\n<li>Dapagliflozin<\/li>\n<li>Digoxin<\/li>\n<li>ACE inhibitors, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Storage_and_Disposal_of_Spironolactone\">Storage and Disposal of Spironolactone<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Store the medicine in a clean, dry and tightly closed container. Keep it away from humidity, excess light and heat. Do not refrigerate.<\/p>\n<p>Always store medicines away from young children and pets. Unused and expired medicines should be disposed of in ways that they do not get consumed by pets, children and other people. Never flush the medicines. If you are not sure about the disposal of the medicine, take it back to your pharmacist.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dietary_Considerations_When_On_Spironolactone\">Dietary Considerations When On Spironolactone<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Since this is a potassium-sparing diuretic, you have to limit potassium-rich foods like bananas, raisins, prunes, and orange juice. Ask your doctor how much of these you can safely consume. You need to strictly avoid potassium-containing salt substitutes while you are on this medication. Reduce your salt (sodium) intake during the course of this medication.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Spironolactone_for_PCOS_Hirsutism_and_Acne_The_Final_Verdict\">Spironolactone for PCOS Hirsutism and Acne: The Final Verdict<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Spironolactone has been used for more than 30 years for treating PCOS hirsutism and acne. A few long-term studies do indicate that this drug is safe. However, it is seen that some women do not complete the treatment course due to the side effects. Side effects are troublesome and a serious cause for concern. But they do resolve once you stop the medication. Because this treatment usually runs for more than 6 months, women face the risks of side effects for a long time. This can create a psychological stress on them. Doctors should weigh the costs with the benefits while recommending spironolactone for PCOS.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t wish to deal with the side-effects that come along with the drugs prescribed for PCOD management?
