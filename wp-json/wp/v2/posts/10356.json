It includes counselling, exercise, meditation, yoga, dietary changes, inclusion of nutritional supplements and sometimes medication (to cope with pain or sleep deprivation). This is because the symptoms of the illness are very diverse. Also the&nbsp;pathophysiology (disordered physiological changes occurring due to an illness) of CFS\/ME remains unknown. Hence, dealing with the illness on a whole is difficult. Medical practitioners resort to treating individual symptoms in the hope that something or the other will help in the long run.<\/p>\n<h2>Does This Mean You Have to Try Many Treatment Options For Your CFS\/ME?<\/h2>\n<p>A vast range of treatment options have been shown to benefit patients with CFS\/ME (although it\u2019s a small percentage of patients who gain the benefits). As a result, no treatment can be ruled out completely.<\/p>\n<p>A survey was conducted with CFS\/ ME patients by the UK-based advocacy group, The ME Association. It was found that when it comes to treatment for CFS\/ME, there\u2019s very little that doesn\u2019t work at all. Thus, deciding on the right treatment could feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. One may have to try different forms of treatment before they find something that works for them.<\/p>\n<p>One way to decide on a treatment option is to decide on which symptom of CFS\/ME do you want to address first:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeling tired on waking up<\/li>\n<li>Chronic exhaustion and the feeling of being ill all the time<\/li>\n<li>The need to improve your short-term memory and concentration<\/li>\n<li>Pain in your muscles<\/li>\n<li>Pain in your joints, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The Controversy Over The PACE Trial<\/h2>\n<p>The World Health Organization classifies CFS\/ME as a neurological condition, implying that it is caused by an unexplained dysfunction in the neurochemistry of the brain. But, many medical practitioners think of CFS\/ME as a neuropsychiatric condition. The latter belief was strengthened by the publication of the results of a study termed the PACE Trial, in 2013. It stated that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Gradual Exercise Therapy (GET) were more effective in treating CFS\/ME than specialist medical care. The implication that CFS is more of a psychiatric disorder than a physiological one left patients coping with the condition feeling disgruntled. Until the pathogenesis of this disorder is better understood, this question will remain an unanswered one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The symptoms of the illness are so diverse and the pathophysiology of it (disordered physiological changes occurring due to an illness) remains unknown. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":19265,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[139],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Why do Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Treatment Options Differ ? | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"A wide range of Chronic fatigue syndrome treatment options have been shown to benefit patients.
