Let&#8217;s look at what are ovarian cysts, their causes, their symptoms, and natural remedies to deal with them.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Are_Ovarian_Cysts\">What Are Ovarian Cysts?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A cyst is a general term used to describe a fluid-filled structure. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that form in or on a woman&#8217;s ovaries.\u00a0\u00a0The ovaries are two small, bean-shaped organs that are a part of the female reproductive system. Women have two ovaries\u00a0\u2013 one on each side of the womb (uterus).<\/p>\n<p>The ovaries have two main functions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To release an egg (ovulation) approximately every 28 days as part of the\u00a0menstrual cycle<\/li>\n<li>To release the female sex hormones &#8212;\u00a0oestrogen and progesterone &#8212; which play an important role in female reproduction<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ovarian cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect one. Many women with ovarian cysts don&#8217;t have symptoms. Most ovarian cysts present little or no discomfort and are harmless.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Types_Of_Ovarian_Cysts\">Types Of Ovarian Cysts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the common types of ovarian cysts.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Polycystic_Ovarian_Syndrome\">Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The condition known as\u00a0Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome\u00a0(PCOS) is characterized by the presence of multiple small cysts within both ovaries. PCOS is associated with a number of hormonal health issues and is the most common cause of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-pregnancy\/\">infertility<\/a> in women.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Follicular_Cysts\">Follicular Cysts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The most common type of ovarian cyst is a follicular cyst, which results from the growth of a follicle. A follicle is the normal fluid-filled sac that contains an egg.\u00a0Follicular cysts\u00a0form when the follicle grows larger than normal during the menstrual cycle and does not open to release the egg. Usually, follicular cysts resolve on their own over the course of days to months. Follicular cysts can contain blood (hemorrhagic cysts) from leakage of blood into the egg sac.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Corpus_Luteum_Cysts\">Corpus Luteum Cysts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A Corpus luteum cyst is related to the menstrual cycle. The corpus luteum is an area of tissue within the ovary that occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle. If a pregnancy doesn&#8217;t occur, the corpus luteum usually breaks down and disappears. It may, however, fill with fluid or blood and persist as a cyst on the ovary. Usually, this cyst is found on only one side, produces no symptoms, and resolves spontaneously.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Chocolate_Cysts\">Chocolate Cysts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Endometriosis\u00a0is a condition in which cells that normally grow inside as a lining of the uterus (womb), instead grow outside of the uterus in other locations. The ovary is a common site for\u00a0endometriosis. When\u00a0endometriosis involves the ovary, the area of endometrial tissue may grow and bleed over time, forming a blood-filled cyst. This cyst has red- or brown-colored contents called an endometrioma, sometimes referred to as a\u00a0&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/chocolate-cyst-endometrioma\/\">chocolate cyst<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dermoid_Cysts_Benign_Cystic_Teratomas\">Dermoid Cysts (Benign Cystic Teratomas)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Both benign and malignant tumors of the ovary may also be cystic. Occasionally, the tissues of the ovary develop abnormally to form other body tissues such as hair or\u00a0teeth. Cysts with these abnormal tissues are really tumors called benign cystic teratomas or\u00a0dermoid cysts.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Tubo-ovarian_Abscesses\">Tubo-ovarian Abscesses<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Infections of the pelvic organs can involve the ovaries and Fallopian tubes. In severe cases, pus-filled cystic spaces may be present on, in, or around the ovary or tubes. These are known as tubo-ovarian abscesses.<\/p>\n<p>The vast majority of ovarian cysts are non-cancerous (benign), although a small number are cancerous (malignant). Cancerous cysts are more common in women who have been through the menopause.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Symptoms_Of_Ovarian_Cysts\">Symptoms Of Ovarian Cysts<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20689\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Period-pain-PCOS.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20689\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20689\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Period-pain-PCOS.webp\" alt=\"Symptoms Of Ovarian Cysts\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Symptoms Of Ovarian Cysts<\/p><\/div>\n<p>An ovarian cyst usually only causes symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or blocks the blood supply to the ovaries.\u00a0In such cases, you may experience:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pelvic pain\u00a0\u2013 this can range from a dull, heavy sensation to a sudden, severe and sharp pain<\/li>\n<li>Pain during sex<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty in emptying your bowels<\/li>\n<li>A frequent need to urinate<\/li>\n<li>Heavy periods,\u00a0irregular periods or lighter periods than normal<\/li>\n<li>Bloating and a swollen tummy<\/li>\n<li>Feeling\u00a0full in spite of eating little food<\/li>\n<li>Difficulty in getting pregnant. Although fertility is unaffected in most women with ovarian cysts.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See\u00a0your doctor if you have persistent symptoms of an ovarian cyst.<\/p>\n<p>Severe symptoms of an ovarian cyst that require immediate medical attention include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Severe or sharp pelvic pain<\/li>\n<li>Fever<\/li>\n<li>Faintness\u00a0or\u00a0dizziness<\/li>\n<li>Rapid breathing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These symptoms can indicate a ruptured cyst or an ovarian torsion.\u00a0In an ovarian torsion, ovary gets\u00a0twisted around the tissues that support it. Both complications can have serious consequences if not treated early.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Who_Can_Get_Affected_By_Ovarian_Cysts\">Who Can Get Affected By Ovarian Cysts?<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Women_Of_All_Ages\">Women Of All Ages<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ovarian cysts are common and affect women of all ages. The vast majority of ovarian cysts are a by-product of hormonal fluctuations that occur during a\u00a0menstrual cycle. Although they may become problematic, they do not indicate a specific disease process. Most ovarian cysts are not cancerous (benign), and many disappear on their own without treatment over the course of several weeks.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Women_With_Regular_Periods\">Women With Regular Periods<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ovarian cysts are more common in women with regular periods. In fact, most women make at least one follicle or corpus luteum cyst every month. You may not be aware that you have a cyst unless there is a problem that causes the cyst to grow or if multiple cysts form. About 8% of premenopausal women develop large cysts that need treatment.\u00a0Ovarian cysts most commonly occur during a woman&#8217;s childbearing years.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Postmenopausal_Women\">Postmenopausal Women<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ovarian cysts are less common after menopause. Postmenopausal women with ovarian cysts are at a higher risk of ovarian cancer. While malignant cysts may be found along with ovarian cancer, ovarian cysts are typically not cancerous.<\/p>\n<p>At any age, see your doctor if you think you have a cyst. You should also see your doctor if you have symptoms such as bloating, frequent urination, pelvic pressure or pain, or unusual vaginal bleeding. These can be signs of a cyst or other serious problem.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Ovarian_Cyst_Risk_Factors\">Ovarian Cyst Risk Factors<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The following are potential risk factors for developing ovarian cysts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polycystic ovarian syndrome<\/li>\n<li>History of previous ovarian cysts<\/li>\n<li>Irregular menstrual cycles<\/li>\n<li>Infertility<\/li>\n<li>Endometriosis<\/li>\n<li>Obesity<\/li>\n<li>Early menstruation (11 years or younger)<\/li>\n<li>Hyperthyroidism<\/li>\n<li>Tamoxifen therapy for\u00a0breast cancer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Diagnosis_Of_Ovarian_Cysts\">Diagnosis Of Ovarian Cysts<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20690\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Ultrasound.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20690\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20690\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Ultrasound.webp\" alt=\"Diagnosis Of Ovarian Cysts\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20690\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diagnosis Of Ovarian Cysts<\/p><\/div>\n<p>A cyst on your ovary can be found during a pelvic exam. Depending on its size and whether it&#8217;s fluid filled, solid or mixed, your doctor is likely to recommend tests to determine the type of cyst and whether you need treatment. Possible tests for diagnosing ovarian cysts include:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pelvic_and_Transvaginal_Ultrasound\">Pelvic and Transvaginal Ultrasound<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ovarian cysts are often detected during a pelvic exam. A pelvis ultrasound can allow the doctor to see the cyst with sound waves and help determine whether it is comprised of fluid, solid tissue, or a mixture of the two. In a\u00a0transvaginal ultrasound, a doctor inserts a probe into the vagina to examine the uterus and ovaries. This examination allows the doctor to view the cyst in more detail.<\/p>\n<p>Cysts can also be detected with other imaging methods, such as a computerized tomography (CT) scan\u00a0or\u00a0MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan.<\/p>\n<p>Because the majority of cysts disappear after a few weeks or months, your doctor may not immediately recommend a treatment plan. Instead, they may repeat the ultrasound test in a few weeks or months to check your condition.<\/p>\n<p>If there aren\u2019t any changes in your condition or if the cyst increases in size, your doctor will request additional tests to determine other causes of your symptoms.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Laparoscopy\">Laparoscopy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>During laparoscopy, a doctor will make small incisions and pass a thin scope (laparoscope) through the abdomen. The laparoscope will allow the doctor to identify the cyst and possibly remove or biopsy the cyst.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Serum_CA-125_Assay\">Serum CA-125 Assay<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A\u00a0cancer-antigen 125 (CA-125) blood test can help in identifying if a cyst is due to\u00a0ovarian cancer. However, other conditions &#8212; including endometriosis and\u00a0uterine fibroids\u00a0&#8212; can also increase CA-125 levels, so this test is not specific for ovarian cancer. In some cases of ovarian cancer, levels of CA-125 are not elevated enough to be detected by a blood test.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hormone_Levels\">Hormone Levels<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The doctor may order a pregnancy test and assess hormone levels. Blood tests can also be performed to test for other hormonal imbalances that may cause PCOS.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Culdocentesis\">Culdocentesis<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Culdocentesis is performed by inserting a needle through the vaginal wall behind the uterine cervix. A fluid sample from the pelvis may be taken in order to rule out bleeding into the abdominal cavity.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Can_Ovarian_Cysts_Be_Prevented\">Can Ovarian Cysts Be Prevented?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Ovarian cysts can\u2019t be prevented. You cannot prevent functional ovarian cysts if you are ovulating. If you get ovarian cysts often, your doctor may prescribe hormonal\u00a0birth control\u00a0to stop you from ovulating. This will help in lowering your risk of getting new cysts. However, routine gynecologic examinations can detect ovarian cysts early. Benign ovarian cysts don\u2019t become cancerous. However, symptoms of ovarian cancer can mimic symptoms of an ovarian cyst. Thus, it\u2019s important to visit your doctor and receive a correct diagnosis. Alert your doctor to symptoms that may indicate a problem, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in your menstrual cycle<\/li>\n<li>Ongoing pelvic pain<\/li>\n<li>Loss of appetite<\/li>\n<li>Unexplained weight loss<\/li>\n<li>Abdominal fullness<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Treatment_Of_Ovarian_Cysts\">Treatment Of Ovarian Cysts<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20692\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Contraceptive-pills-pcos.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20692\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20692\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Contraceptive-pills-pcos.webp\" alt=\"Treatment Of Ovarian Cysts\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Treatment Of Ovarian Cysts<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Treatment depends on your age, the type and size of your cyst, and your symptoms. Your doctor might suggest:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Watchful_Waiting\">Watchful Waiting<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In many cases, you can wait and get yourself re-examined to see if the cyst goes away within a few months. This is typically an option \u2014 regardless of your age \u2014 if you have no symptoms and an ultrasound shows you have a simple, small, fluid-filled cyst.<\/p>\n<p>Your doctor will likely recommend that you get follow-up pelvic ultrasounds at intervals to see if there&#8217;s a change in your cyst size.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Medication\">Medication<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your doctor might recommend hormonal contraceptives, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/side-effects-birth-control-pills\/\">birth control pills<\/a>, to keep ovarian cysts from recurring. However, birth control pills won&#8217;t shrink an existing cyst.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Surgery\">Surgery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your doctor might suggest removing a cyst that is large, doesn&#8217;t look like a functional cyst, is growing, continues through two or three menstrual cycles, or causes pain.<\/p>\n<p>Some cysts can be removed without removing the ovary (ovarian cystectomy.) In some cases, your doctor might suggest removing the affected ovary and leaving the other (non-affected) ovary intact (oophorectomy.)<\/p>\n<p>If a cystic mass is cancerous, your doctor will likely refer you to a gynecologic cancer specialist. You might need to have your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes removed (total hysterectomy) and possibly chemotherapy or radiation. Your doctor is also likely to recommend surgery when an ovarian cyst develops after menopause.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Natural_Ways_To_Deal_With_Ovarian_Cysts\">Natural Ways To Deal With Ovarian Cysts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are natural options that could be effective for managing functional ovarian cysts. These therapies should only be started after consulting your doctor. The key to getting rid of an ovarian cyst is to\u00a0equalize your hormones\u00a0and diminish factors that contribute to your cyst. Too much exposure to estrogen and xenoestrogen (estrogen imitators) can disrupt ovulation and lead to the formation of cysts.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Things_To_Avoid_To_Get_Rid_Of_Ovarian_Cyst\">Things To Avoid To Get Rid Of Ovarian Cyst<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_20693\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/avoid-plastic-water-bottles.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20693\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20693\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/avoid-plastic-water-bottles.webp\" alt=\"Things To Avoid To Get Rid Of Ovarian Cyst\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20693\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Things To Avoid To Get Rid Of Ovarian Cyst<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Processed soy\u00a0products:<\/strong> Examples of these products include soy protein isolate and imitation meat.
