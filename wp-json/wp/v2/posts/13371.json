Because it is a complex condition, some women don\u2019t even realize they have been suffering from PCOS for years. A few irregular periods are normal and expected, after all. Many of us don\u2019t know something isn\u2019t right until we try to get pregnant.<\/p>\n<p>If that\u2019s been the case with you, false unicorn root may just be the right herb for you. It is an all-natural aid to help with menstrual regularity and also boost your fertility,<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"False_Unicorn_Its_Benefits_For_Fertility\">False Unicorn &amp; Its Benefits For Fertility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>False unicorn root is popularly known as a fertility herb. Herbalists and naturopaths have found it to be an effective for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a health tonic for the reproductive organs<\/li>\n<li>Restoring hormonal balance<\/li>\n<li>Regulating menstrual cycle<\/li>\n<li>Easing menstrual pain<\/li>\n<li>Treating menstrual cramps<\/li>\n<li>Preventing vaginal dryness<\/li>\n<li>Preventing miscarriage<\/li>\n<li>Treating a prolapsed uterus<\/li>\n<li>Shrinking ovarian cysts<\/li>\n<li>Boosting fertility<\/li>\n<li>As a natural diuretic to keep bloating at bay<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201100503\/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scientist<\/a>s are still trying to study false unicorn in detail. An\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/np200100a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investigation<\/a>\u00a0of false unicorn root in 2011 led to the isolation of two new plant steroids from it. The investigation was done by The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy. <a href=\"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/np300393y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Further research in 2012<\/a> led to the isolation of more plant steroids from false unicorn root. These studies suggest the use of false unicorn as an estrogen regulator. This property of the herb may contribute to menstrual cycle regulation. This would also explain why false unicorn root works well for all hormonal ailments in women.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/getting-pregnant-metformin-alone\/\">Q: Is It Possible For A Woman With PCOS To Get Pregnant With Metformin Alone?<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Does_False_Unicorn_Work_For_PCOS\">How Does False Unicorn Work For PCOS?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A tonic made with false unicorn root interacts with the body&#8217;s estrogen receptor sites. It\u2019s believed that this process increases estrogen levels in the body. This process aids the ovaries to produce a mature egg during ovulation.<\/p>\n<p>PCOS comes with a failure to ovulate and menstruate in 50% of the patients. As a result, false unicorn root can be especially helpful for these patients. If you\u2019re also trying to get pregnant, this herb can be a double blessing. Many PCOS patients turn to this herb to normalize hormones when they discontinue birth control pills.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_False_Unicorn_Root\">What is False Unicorn Root?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>False Unicorn Root is an herbaceous perennial. It is native to North America, but is also found in abundance in eastern Canada. This beautiful flowering herb is known by many other names. Fairywand, helionas dioica, devil\u2019s bit and blazing star root are other common names for the same herb.<\/p>\n<p>The roots and dried rhizome of False Unicorn have medicinal use. These were used as a Native American herbal remedy to normalize periods and boost fertility.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_To_Use_False_Unicorn_Root\">How To Use False Unicorn Root?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20181\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/How-To-Use-False-Unicorn-Root.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20181\" class=\"wp-image-20181 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/How-To-Use-False-Unicorn-Root.webp\" alt=\"false unicorn root\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20181\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">How To Use False Unicorn Root?<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The herb combines well with Echinacea\u00a0and Vitex Agnus Castus (chasteberry) to treat other symptoms of PCOS. These combinations alleviate PMS symptoms and treat chronic pelvic inflammation.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The easiest way to use False Unicorn root is to brew a cup of healing tea with it. Add 1 teaspoon of the dried root into a cup of water. Allow it to come to a boil. Simmer gently for 10-15 minutes. Let the tea cool down before sipping on it. You may have a cup of this tea up to 3 times a day.<\/li>\n<li>You can also find pre-made false unicorn root tincture. If buying this, take 2- 4ml thrice daily.<\/li>\n<li>If you are buying dried false unicorn root powder, take 1-2gm thrice a day.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This potent herb should only be used after consulting with a naturopathic physician or skilled herbalist. Never combine false unicorn root with estrogen replacement drugs without discussing with your doctor. It can be toxic in large doses and adversely affect your cardiac health.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-healthy-pregnancy\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">PCOS And Healthy Pregnancy: Everything You Need To Know!<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"False_Unicorn_Root_Is_Rare_and_Precious\">False Unicorn Root Is Rare and Precious<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A word for the wise: Wild harvesting of False Unicorn Root has made the herb as an endangered one. \u00a0As this herb gained fame for its abilities to regulate menstruation and prevent miscarriage, the natural crop started to suffer. Once the rhizome root (from which the herbal medicine is made) is harvested, it doesn\u2019t grow back. Despite great effort, regrowth of the rhizome by cultivators across the U.S. has shown little to no success. For this reason, we urge you to use this medicinal herb responsibly. Also, you should only buy it from reliable sources. Always opt for ethically wildcrafted or grown organically sources.<\/p>\n<p>This is also the reason you may find False Unicorn Root to be somewhat expensive. If you\u2019re looking for other more affordable herbal options, we recommend Vitex Agnus Castus, \u00a0Licorice\u00a0and Dong Quai for PCOS.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
