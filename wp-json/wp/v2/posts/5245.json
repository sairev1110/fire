Acarbose, or Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors act by blocking enzymes that digest carbohydrates in the small intestine. Carbohydrates are broken down into sugars in our body. When Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors act, the rate at which carbohydrates are broken down into sugar is reduced. As a result, the speed at which sugar enters the bloodstream slows down. This leads to lower blood sugar levels. Diabetics using this drug have to deal with acarbose side effects. These include digestive troubles due to <strong>acarbose\u2019s mechanism of action<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Mechanism_of_Action\"><span id=\"Mechanism_of_Action\">Mechanism of Action<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Acarbose works by slowing down two enzymes whose job is to digest complex carbs into simple sugars. This inhibition is temporary and while these enzymes still continue digest carbs, the rate at which they do so is greatly reduced.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"How_Should_Acarbose_be_Used\"><span id=\"How_Should_Acarbose_be_Used\">How Should Acarbose be Used?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Acarbose is <a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/druginfo\/meds\/a696015.html#special-dietary\">a tablet<\/a>, usually taken three times a day. It is very important to take each dose with the first bite of each main meal. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully. If you do not understand something, ask your healthcare practitioner or pharmacist. Take acarbose exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed. Continue to take acarbose even if you feel well. Do not stop taking acarbose without talking to your healthcare practitioner.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Most_Prescribed_Brand_Names_of_Acarbose_Include\"><span id=\"Most_Prescribed_Brand_Names_of_Acarbose_Include\">Most Prescribed Brand Names of Acarbose Include<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Glyset, Precose Euglitol, Mignar, Elitox, Glucarb, Discarb and Disorb<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Side_Effects_That_Could_Happen_as_Soon_as_You_Start_Taking_Acarbose\"><span id=\"Side_Effects_That_Could_Happen_as_Soon_as_You_Start_Taking_Acarbose\">Side Effects That Could Happen as Soon as You Start Taking Acarbose<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Digestive_Issues\">Digestive Issues<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18720\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Histamine-3-2nd-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18720\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18720\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Histamine-3-2nd-image.webp\" alt=\"Common Acarbose side effects are flatulence, feeling bloated, abdominal pains and diarrhea. \" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Common Acarbose side effects are flatulence, feeling bloated, abdominal pains and diarrhea.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The most common Acarbose side effects are flatulence, feeling bloated, abdominal pains and diarrhea.
