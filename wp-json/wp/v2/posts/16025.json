It\u2019s uncomfortable and annoying, and you\u2019ve tried seemingly <em>everything<\/em>\u2014but to no avail. Could there be a missing piece you haven\u2019t yet considered?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Could_it_Be_hypothyroidism_and_constipation\">Could it Be hypothyroidism and constipation?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The most common thyroid disorder, hypothyroidism and constipation results in symptoms like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low Energy and Fatigue<\/li>\n<li>Increased Sensitivity to Cold<\/li>\n<li>Dry Skin<\/li>\n<li>Weight Gain<\/li>\n<li>Muscle Weakness<\/li>\n<li>Brittle Nails<\/li>\n<li>High Cholesterol<\/li>\n<li>Memory Problems<\/li>\n<li>Irritability<\/li>\n<li>Muscle Aches and Stiffness<\/li>\n<li>Thinning Hair<\/li>\n<li>Depression and you guessed it\u2014constipation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These are just some of the most common symptoms, which are different for each person. But constipation is one issue that plagues many sufferers of hypothyroidism.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Does_The_Thyroid_Play_Into_hypothyroidism_and_constipation\">How Does The Thyroid Play Into hypothyroidism and constipation ?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the throat that has an enormous impact on how our bodies operate\u2014and accordingly, how we feel. According to Dr. Jamie Coroon, N.D., \u201cIt stores and produces hormones that affect the function of virtually every organ in our bodies.\u201d That\u2019s quite a lot of impact.<\/p>\n<p>Hypothyroidism is essentially an under-active thyroid gland. And when you consider the role that the thyroid plays in so many bodily functions, chief among them being your metabolism, heart, and body temperature, thenit makes sense that a sluggish thyroid would result in a slowing down of many of the systems in your body\u2014including your digestive tract.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Whats_The_Connection\">What\u2019s The Connection?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The muscles that line the digestive tract of the small and large intestines contract to move stool through the intestines. Hypothyroidism weakens those contractions, so the stool moves too slowly through your system. This is how constipation can happen for those struggling with hypothyroidism\u2014many of who may not even know it.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Constipation_Is_More_Than_Just_Discomfort\">Constipation Is More Than Just Discomfort<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18442\" style=\"width: 1910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/constipation-main_image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18442\" class=\"wp-image-18442 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/constipation-main_image.webp\" alt=\"severe constipation symptoms\" width=\"1900\" height=\"992\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18442\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">constipation side effects<\/p><\/div>\n<p>You already know constipation is no fun. But besides the discomfort, there are other reasons it\u2019s important to address it. According to Chris Kresser, L.Ac., constipation can impair your body\u2019s ability to clear out hormones from your system, resulting in rises in estrogen levels. This results in a decrease of free thyroid hormones available to the body, worsening the original problem.<\/p>\n<p>Low levels of thyroid hormones equal low thyroid function, which slows transit time. This causes constipation, which in turn increases gut inflammation, infections, and malabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract. No good!<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Magnesium_to_The_Rescue\">Magnesium to The Rescue<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may have tried stool softeners, laxatives, herbal teas, and the like to open the floodgates. But many people have had success using magnesium supplements to help their constipation.<\/p>\n<p>Magnesium has a relaxing effect on blood vessels, muscles, and tension. So when we don\u2019t have enough of it, we may feel tense and tight. Magnesium relaxes these constrictions.It soothes and relaxes the digestive muscles too, helping digestion work more efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>Magnesium is a mineral that many of us are deficient in, yet it\u2019s absolutely essential to a properly functioning system. It is a macro-mineral\u20141 of the 6 essential minerals that the body needs in large quantities. Even if you eat a healthy diet full of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other whole foods, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be able to get enough magnesium from foods alone.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Diet_Alone_Wont_Cut_it\">Diet Alone Won\u2019t Cut it<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In fact, the World Health Organization reported that 75% of all people don\u2019t get enough magnesium through their diet.<\/p>\n<p>In her book, \u201cThe Magnesium Miracle,\u201d Dr. Carolyn Dean, M.D., N.D., says: \u201cTo obtain enough magnesium from the diet takes special care and knowledge of magnesium-rich foods, but we still need to supplement with magnesium.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We used to get adequate magnesium by eating foods that were grown in mineral-rich soils, as the minerals would seep into the foods during the growing process. But our soils are now depleted and don\u2019t offer enough of the minerals we need to stay healthy and functioning optimally.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mighty_Magnesium\">Mighty Magnesium<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Supplementation is a simple, easy way to get the magnesium you need. For constipation, magnesium oxide may be the way to go. It is not very bio-available, so instead of being absorbed into your tissues and increasing overall magnesium levels, it stays bound in the GI tract to help things move along.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dosage_Ideas\">Dosage Ideas<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The recommended daily dose (RDA) for magnesium is 300 mg per day. According to Dr. Mark Hyman, M.D., most of us get far less than 200 mg, and we actually need more like 400\u20131,000 mg, depending on the state of our health and level of deficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Think about starting with 1 capsule (100\u2013300 mg) of magnesium oxide or citrate before bed. Dr. Steve Clark, N.D., recommends starting with 1 pill, then increasing by 1 daily until stools are normal. Then stick to that dosage. He says not to exceed 900\u20131,000 mg per day.\u00a0Too high of a dose can cause diarrhea or loose stools, so it may be best to start low and slow, and wait to see how you do.<\/p>\n<p>Once you find the right dose that is enough to get things moving but not too much that you have loose stools, it might be a good idea to stick to that daily or nightly to keep things moving.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Note<\/strong>:<\/span> If you have kidney issues, kidney disease, or severe heart disease, run this by your doctor before starting to supplement with magnesium. Those with kidney issues may have a hard time excreting byproducts of magnesium. If you\u2019re taking medication or are at all worried about supplementing with magnesium, talk to your healthcare practitioner.\u00a0Once you do begin supplementing, we hope you see the wonderful benefits magnesium can offer!
