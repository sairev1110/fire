The Ayurvedic View"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>During your periods, it&#8217;s natural to feel lethargic, sleepy and low on energy. However, a lot of women don\u2019t seem to give in to those feelings. Let&#8217;s find out why it&#8217;s important to rest during periods.<\/p>\n<h2>Low Energy During Periods: The Ayurvedic Explanation<\/h2>\n<p>In Ayurveda, the menstrual cycle is treated as a cleanse. It is regarded as a gift to the female body that should be received gracefully every month. As with any cleanse, the body requires rest to rejuvenate and balance the three <em>doshas<\/em> (biological energies found within the body). These three energies are namely <em>Vata<\/em> (Air), <em>Pitta<\/em> (Fire) and <em>Kapha<\/em> (Water). \u00a0A woman faces different symptoms depending on the energy with which there is an imbalance.<\/p>\n<p>The dosha that controls movement in the body is the Vata. The sub-dosha that governs the menstrual cycle is called the <em>Apana Vata<\/em>. Being a downward force of energy, this vata is associated with the elimination of wastes from the body and is located between the navel and the anus. This energy helps in making the birthing\/periods a smooth process.<\/p>\n<p>For these processes to take place effectively, the Apana Vata must work in sync with the <em>Prana Vata, or the energy that governs the\u00a0movement of life force<\/em>. The Prana is an upward energy force that is required for healthy functioning of the mind.<\/p>\n<p>The opposing forces of both these vats need to move in their respective flows for normal periods. But, often, these forces end up attempting to support one another. Since the mental workload is high because of today\u2019s lifestyle, the Apana Vata turns upward and tries to support the Prana Vata. This leaves a limited downward flow of energy at the time of periods. And this low energy results in various symptoms like a backache and irregular periods. In turn, to help complete the menstruation process, the Prana Vata moves downward, resulting in mental effects like moodiness, negative emotional changes, and tiredness.<\/p>\n<h2>Rest: A Natural Requirement Of Your Body During Periods<\/h2>\n<p>Notice how these issues arise due to a lack of energy? Rest is a natural requirement of the body and must be honored when asked for. But rest, especially during periods, is looked at as a weakness. However, we tend to forget that there must be a reason we feel the way we do. Just like one feels tired after a long day and needs rest, here are a few things you should practice during your periods for maintaining a balance of energy all month long:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give your body the rest it asks for during your periods, at least for a day.<\/li>\n<li>Follow a 7 to 8-hour <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/sleep\/effects-of-sleep-deprivation\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">sleep<\/a> cycle every day, at the same time.<\/li>\n<li>Keep your body from becoming stiff with light stretching or a short walk.<\/li>\n<li>Eat fresh fruits and vegetables that are easy to digest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During your periods, it&#8217;s natural to feel lethargic, sleepy and low on energy.
