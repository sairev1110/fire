This stage is known as peri-menopause and can start to occur even 10 years before menopause. Periods may become more frequent at first and women may experience excessive bleeding. But, the reverse is also possible.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Hot_Flashes\">Hot Flashes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A hot flash is a feeling of sudden heat in the body. A woman\u2019s face may turn red and look flushed and there might be constant sweating too. The exact cause of these flashes isn\u2019t known, but it could be related to a change in blood circulation.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Vaginal_Dryness_Which_May_Cause_Pain_During_Intercourse\">Vaginal Dryness (Which May Cause Pain During Intercourse)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Some women may face vaginal dryness \u00a0before menopause, but it becomes even more common during it. The dryness occurs due to a drop in estrogen levels. Dryness may only cause irritation at first, but it can lead to pain during sex too.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Problems_in_Sleeping\">Problems in Sleeping<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Severe hot flashes may lead to trouble with sleep. As many as 61% of women face insomnia or some other kind of sleeping challenge during menopause. Women may also experience breathing problems during sleep, and as a result, snore more than usual during signs of menopause.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Decreased_Libido\">Decreased Libido<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Even though libido, or sex drive, gradually decreases in men and women with age, the decline is two to three times more in women. This drop in libido could occur due to a hormonal imbalance, which is caused by a drop in estrogen levels during the transition. It could also result in depressive thoughts, in some cases.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Depression_or_Mood_Swings\">Depression or Mood Swings<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Women may face depression or severe moods swings during menopause.\u00a0While, mood swings are common in many women during their menstrual cycles, the severity of these swings may increase during menopause.
