But can good bacterial <em>actually<\/em> impact mental health issues like depression, reduce high blood pressure and bad cholesterol, reduce allergies and even cause stunning weight loss? As we are slowly finding out \u2013 all this is just scratching the surface of the things our hundred trillion strong army of friendly bacteria can do for us!<\/p>\n<p>Probiotics are known to increase our natural immunity (since 80% of our immune cells reside in our gut and that\u2019s where most of the bacteria are as well). They are also known to help those with digestive and gut issues like diarrhea and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Over and above these, there are amazing things that research now shows probiotics can be used for.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"5_Incredible_Things_Probiotics_Do_That_We_Dont_Often_Hear_About\">5 Incredible Things Probiotics Do That We Don\u2019t Often Hear About<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Brain_Food_to_Fight_Those_Blues\">Brain Food to Fight Those Blues<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18513\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Benefits-of-Probiotics.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18513\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18513\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Benefits-of-Probiotics.webp\" alt=\"benefits of probiotics\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">benefits of probiotics<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Repeated bouts of the blues getting you down? Memory lapses annoying you? Brain degeneration with age is caused by the loss of neurons and synapses, inflammation in brain tissue and weaker activation signals in parts of the brain. Stress sits at the center of it all, stoking the fire. Repeated infections also adversely impact the brain.<\/p>\n<p>Research shows that the right mix of probiotics can modulate your gut flora, which also decreases brain tissue inflammation and builds immunity. This helps the synapses in your brain to work better. Probiotics can also reduce brain hypersensitivity, helping reduce stress and anxiety, characteristic of mental health problems like depression.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Releasing_The_Valve_On_Blood_Pressure\">Releasing The Valve On Blood Pressure<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Recent research suggests that there is a deep link between blood pressure and the composition of your \u2018gut flora\u2019, or the bacteria in your intestines. A reduction in the numbers of good bacteria or imbalance in this gut flora \u2013 known as dysbiosis &#8211; directly coincides with an increased blood pressure. If you get the right bacteria in and eat healthy food that feeds it, you can dial that high blood pressure back. One study even showed that using a powerful germicidal mouth wash each day led to an increase in blood pressure because the mouthwash killed certain oral probiotics, whose natural action was to help produce nitric oxide and expand blood vessels, to keep <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/herbs-lower-blood-pressure\/\">blood pressure down<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Controlling_Cholesterol_Lowering_Diabetes_Risk\">Controlling Cholesterol, Lowering Diabetes Risk<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may simply know probiotics to help with \u201cbetter digestion\u201d \u2013 but let\u2019s look a little deeper. Probiotics help increase the secretion of particular chemicals that act to reduce blood cholesterol by preventing cholesterol from being absorbed in the intestines. Probiotics also reduce insulin resistance, helping the insulin in your body work better, lowering diabetes risk too.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Probiotics_for_Eczema_Asthma_And_Allergies\">Probiotics for Eczema, Asthma And Allergies<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In a study, whenpregnant women were given a particular strain of the lactobacillus bacteria, it reduced the incidence of diseases like asthma and atopic eczema among the newborn children. The beneficial effects of the probiotics for the children extend beyond atopic diseases and provide increased immunity, higher antibody production and a stronger gastrointestinal system. This boosted immunity helps fight <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/how-to-reverse-autoimmune-disease\/\">autoimmune disorders <\/a>that are responsible for symptoms like irritable skin and shortness in breathing. The reduction of inflammation from the probiotics also helps reduce the sensitivity of the skin to allergens.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Weight_loss_Anyone\">Weight loss, Anyone?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Probiotics have been studied in otherwise healthy people to positively impact how their bodies handle weight gain (to reduce deposition of abdominal fat). In people with obesity issues, they have been shown to help people lose weight and keep it off. Research reveals that consuming the right probiotics could help your body digest carbohydrates in a different, more efficient manner.<\/p>\n<p>When combined with how benefits of probiotics help improve insulin sensitivity, its not surprising that they can give you a leg up in your fight against that bulging belly.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Bonus_Feature_The_Antidote_to_Antibiotics\">Bonus Feature: The Antidote to Antibiotics!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>What many of us don\u2019t realize is that when we suffer from an infection and the doctor gives us antibiotics, these pills kill both, the good and the bad bacteria, leaving our bodies more vulnerable to other opportunistic infections. The consumption of probiotics replenishes the good bacteria, strengthening the body once again.<\/p>\n<p>A study in 2012 showed that out of over 11,000 people consuming antibiotics, those supplementing probiotics had a much lower incidence of inflammatory issues related to digestion.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Benjamin Kliger, Associate Professor of Clinical Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, says \u201cWith the level of evidence that probiotics work and the large safety margins for them, we see no good reason not to prescribe probiotics when prescribing antibiotics.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The thumb rule used by several naturopathic doctors is that for every day that you take an antibiotic, you need to take a probiotic for 3 days.<\/p>\n<p>During the days you are on the prescription antibiotics, the probiotic must be taken at least 3 hours away from the antibiotic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/how-to-choose-the-right-probiotic\/\">How to choose the right probiotic: Gut Secrets Decoded<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 5 Incredible Things Probiotics Do That We Don\u2019t Often Hear About1.1 Brain Food to Fight Those Blues1.2 Releasing The Valve On Blood Pressure1.3 Controlling Cholesterol, Lowering Diabetes Risk1.4 Probiotics for Eczema, Asthma And Allergies1.5 Weight loss, Anyone?1.6 Bonus Feature: The Antidote to Antibiotics!
