This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you and about your use of sepalika.com and its services. It will explain the choices you have about how your personal information is used and how we protect that information. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. Moonjur Healthcare operates sepalika.com and may operate other websites, all of which will follow the mandate of said Privacy Policy. The terms and conditions of this Privacy are legally binding on all users. By using this web site, you consent to this Agreement and to the collection and use of information by Moonjur Healthcare Pvt Ltd as specified below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website Visitors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the Moonjur Healthcare Network, our Web servers automatically recognize several kinds of information. Like most website operators, Moonjur Healthcare collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use this website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moonjur Healthcare also collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Moonjur Healthcare blogs\/sites. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the website, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gathering Of Personally-Identifying Information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Moonjur Healthcare gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. \u201cPersonal Information\u201d means information that we can use to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number or email address. Some of our interactive tools and services may request you to submit health information, which would also be considered Personal Information. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Information that you submit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At various times as you use the website, you will be given the option of providing us with Personal Information in order to receive recurring informational\/promotional newsletters\/ or email a friend option \u2013 such as a newsletter relating to a specific health condition \u2013 via email from us and\/or directly from third parties. From time to time we make subscriptions to our newsletters available on third party websites. If you sign up for one of our newsletters on a third party site the site will provide us with your Personal Information such as your email address and we may use that information as described in this Privacy Policy as though you had provided it directly to us. You may unsubscribe from a newsletter by following the directions included at the bottom of the newsletter and\/or logging in to the websites and unchecking the newsletters you no longer wish to receive under appropriate section.<br>However, Moonjur Healthcare does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aggregated Statistics And Market Research<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moonjur Healthcare may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Moonjur Healthcare may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Moonjur Healthcare does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below.<br>From time to time, we may conduct online research surveys through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus groups. When participating in a survey, the Personal Information you submit may be used by us for research and measurement purposes, including to measure the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Extent Of Protection Of Personally-Identifying Information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moonjur Healthcare discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at our websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using our websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Moonjur Healthcare discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a court order or other governmental request or mandated by law, or when Moonjur Healthcare believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Moonjur Healthcare, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Moonjur Healthcare website and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what\u2019s going on with us and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Moonjur Healthcare takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We currently use WhatsApp for business to interact with you over WhatsApp. Please note that whatsApp reserves the right to access and use this data as defined in their policy.

If you mistakenly post Personal Information in our Community areas and would like it removed, you can send us an email to request that we remove it<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cookies And Web Beacons<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Moonjur Healthcare uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of website, and their website access preferences. Our visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the websites, with the drawback that certain features of Moonjur Healthcare websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWeb Beacons\u201d are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the Web Beacon is located, the type of browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you\u2019ve seen an advertisement. Moonjur Healthcare and \/or our advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Advertisements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Advertisements appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by us and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Opt-Out Or Unsubscribe<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every communication we send you will contain a clearly worded \u201cOpt-Out\u201d or \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link allowing you to withdraw your permission for future mailings. Please allow five to seven days for processing. Permission changes will however not affect any information which you provided to us and which we previously shared with third parties and\/or content partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Business Transfers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If Moonjur Healthcare or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Moonjur Healthcare goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Moonjur Healthcare may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Data Security<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moonjur Healthcare is committed to doing its best to maintain the security of information collected on our site.<br>While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to put in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. When you place orders for purchased products or access your payment information, we use industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology to protect the storage and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties. Encryption is a process by which a message or information is scrambled while it is in transit to our website SSL codes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. In addition to our online security efforts, we take steps to protect your personal data offline, as well. All sensitive information and\/or systems that house that information (i.e., computers or filing cabinet) have physically restricted access in our offices. Employees are granted access on a need-to-know basis pursuant to specific job function requirements (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative). Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices through periodic training sessions in an effort to keep security awareness levels high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy Policy Changes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and in our sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to our Privacy Policy. If you have an account, you might also receive an alert informing you of these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Complete Agreement<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Except as expressly provided in a particular \u201clegal notice\u201d on the Moonjur Healthcare websites, this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use and General Disclaimers constitute the entire agreement between you and Moonjur Healthcare with respect to the use of the Moonjur Healthcare websites, and content therein.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Grievance Redressal<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Redressal Mechanism: Any complaints, abuse or concerns with regards to content and or comment or breach of these terms shall be immediately informed to the designated Grievance Officer as mentioned below via in writing or through email signed with the electronic signature to Grievance Officer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shivani Dhurve<br>Grievance Officer<br>www.sepalika.com<br>Moonjur Healthcare Pvt Ltd<br>Workspace, Orbit Terraces,<br>3rd Floor, NM Joshi Marg,<br>Lower Parel ,Mumbai<br>Email: contact@sepalika.com<br>Ph: +91 9867337112<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation.
