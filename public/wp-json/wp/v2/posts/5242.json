It is administered orally. Postprandial Blood Glucose Regulators (Glinides) are chemicals that stimulate the<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beta_cell\"> beta cells<\/a> in the pancreas to produce more insulin. Glinides, or postprandial (meaning \u201cafter meal\u201d) glucose regulators, are usually taken half an hour before food. This helps to increase the amount of insulin available to escort the glucose produced after meals into the cells. Thus, it prevents the build-up of sugar in the blood.<\/p>\n<p>Glinides are often prescribed to patients who need drugs to stimulate their pancreas to produce more insulin (such as sulfonylureas) but have an allergy to sulfa drugs.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Mechanism_of_Action\"><span id=\"Mechanism_of_Action\">Mechanism of Action<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Repaglinide <a href=\"https:\/\/dailymed.nlm.nih.gov\/dailymed\/drugInfo.cfm?setid=4c1c212f-71a5-4dd3-81b2-cd9e2148774c\">lowers blood glucose levels<\/a> by triggering the release of insulin from the pancreas. They can only act in the presence of functioning beta cells present in the pancreatic islets. The insulin mediated by Repaglinide is glucose-dependent and diminishes as glucose levels get lower.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"How_Should_This_Medicine_Be_Used\"><span id=\"How_Should_This_Medicine_Be_Used\">How Should This Medicine Be Used?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Repaglinide is available as a tablet to be taken orally. The doses should be taken before meals &#8211; any time from 30 minutes before a meal to just before the meal. Repaglinides work only when you consume food. So, if you miss a meal, you need to miss the dose of repaglinide as well. Conversely, if you eat an additional meal, you will need to take an additional dose of repaglinide. Depending on how you respond, your healthcare provider may or may not, gradually, increase your dose. Follow the instructions written on your prescription label carefully. Also, ask your healthcare practitioner or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take repaglinide exactly as directed, do not take higher or lower amounts of any dosage. Preferably, stick to the dosage directed to you by your healthcare practitioner \/ the package label \/ patient information leaflet.<\/p>\n<p>You need to continue taking repaglinide even if you feel well. Do not stop taking repaglinide without talking to your healthcare practitioner.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Most_Prescribed_Names_In_This_Category_of_Drugs_Include\"><span id=\"Most_Prescribed_Names_In_This_Category_of_Drugs_Include\">Most Prescribed Names In This Category of Drugs Include<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prandin<\/li>\n<li>Starlix Rapamon<\/li>\n<li>Regan<\/li>\n<li>Glinate 120<\/li>\n<li>Nebicard<\/li>\n<li>Natiz 60<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Postprandial Blood Glucose Regulators (Repaglinide) Side Effects<\/p>\n<p>The common <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rxlist.com\/prandin-side-effects-drug-center.htm\">side effects <\/a>of Repaglinide are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digestive issues &#8211; Including diarrhea, constipation and abdominal pain.<\/li>\n<li>Low blood sugar &#8211; Can cause shaking, palpitations, dizziness, extreme hunger, fuzzy vision, fainting, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Allergic reactions &#8211; Including a stuffy nose, cold-like symptoms, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Cardiovascular issues &#8211; Including palpitations, a racing heart and other heart-related issues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The reason these side effects occur are also explained in detail below.

They enhance the secretion of insulin in the blood stream, just before food. They act fast, so sugar levels can drop rapidly when you take them.

This is especially true for those having a liver condition.<\/strong> The only short-term solution that may exist is to change your drug and that is a decision your healthcare practitioner can help you with. You should also maintain a <strong>postprandial blood sugar level chart<\/strong> to monitor your glucose levels. This will point out deviations and help you gauge the efficacy of your anti-diabetic medication.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Should_You_Be_Using_Glinides_Over_The_Long_Term\"><span id=\"Should_You_Be_Using_Glinides_Over_The_Long_Term\">Should You Be Using Glinides Over The Long Term?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Generally, glinides are prescribed to those diabetics who are allergic to sulfonylureas. However, research shows that due to hypoglycemia, they can cause adverse effects too. Patients who use glinides for a long period may suffer from other health complications, as a result of vital nutrients being removed from the body.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Side_Effects_Of_Long_Term_Use_of_Repaglinide_Glinides\"><span id=\"Side_Effects_Of_Long_Term_Use_of_Repaglinide_Glinides\">Side Effects Of Long Term Use of Repaglinide (Glinides)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>CoQ10 depletion is a major cause of the side effects experienced due to the usage of Repaglinide. Here is a list of common symptoms that you might experience if you\u2019ve been taking Repaglinide (or glinides) for a long time:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Tiredness\">Tiredness<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Does a regular day at the office makes you feel more tired than usual? It could be due to the depletion of Coenzyme Q10. CoQ10 is involved in the energy production for muscles and the depletion of this important coenzyme can cause fatigue, tiredness and lethargy.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Digestive_Issues-2\">Digestive Issues<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Have stomach ache, nausea and constipation been plaguing you recently? Your drug could be the cause of that. Glinides are known to deplete CoQ10, which is an important coenzyme in the digestive process as well. Gingivitis or gum problems could also occur due to CoQ10 depletion.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cardiac_Trouble_and_Muscle_Pain\">Cardiac Trouble and Muscle Pain<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Unexplained muscle pain could, also, be due to CoQ10 depletion. CoQ10 is one of the most important nutrients in the body since it is used as a coenzyme for energy production. Being the most demanding muscle in the body, an energy crunch hits the heart hard. A lack of CoQ10 can cause high blood pressure, angina and serious conditions, like congestive heart failure.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What_You_Can_Do_About_It\"><span id=\"What_You_Can_Do_About_It\">What You Can Do About It<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Replenishing your body\u2019s stock of vital nutrients can help you cope with some of these nutrient-depletion symptoms. These dietary supplements are safe, however, it\u2019s advisable to involve your medical practitioner, especially if you\u2019re on prescription medications.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What_May_Help_Per_Day\"><span id=\"What_May_Help_Per_Day\">What May Help (Per Day)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>CoQ10: 30-200 mcg<\/p>\n<p>Research shows that supplementing can help you mitigate risks and protect your body from the side effects associated with using prescription drugs.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What_Are_The_Special_Precautions_You_Should_Follow\"><span id=\"What_Are_The_Special_Precautions_You_Should_Follow\">What Are The Special Precautions You Should Follow?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Before taking Repaglinide,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inform your healthcare practitioner and pharmacist about being allergic to repaglinide or any other drugs.<\/li>\n<li>Inform your healthcare practitioner if you are taking <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gemfibrozil\">gemfibrozil<\/a> (sold as Lopid).
