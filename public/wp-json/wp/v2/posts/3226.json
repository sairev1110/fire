This is most reliably measured by the HbA1c test, which measures how much sugar is coating your red blood cells on average over roughly 120 days. There are other tests too, that some doctors believe are better at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/prediabetes-risk-test-tool\/\">catching diabetes earlier<\/a>, at the prediabetes stage. When we ask \u201cwhat causes Type 2 diabetes?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>we can answer this question in two ways. One, we can look at the factors that are known to increase the risk of diabetes and two, we can look at what actually happens in the body, as a mechanism, before you develop a <strong>type 2 diabetes diagnosis<\/strong>. Let\u2019s look at both.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Risk_Factors_Associated_with_Diabetes\"><span id=\"Risk_Factors_Associated_with_Diabetes\">Risk Factors Associated with Diabetes<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"1_Genetics\">1. Genetics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you have a close family member with diabetes, it increases your chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes significantly. Mind you, like all genetics, we know from research that this is not a dead end. \u2018Epigenetics\u2019 or how you live plays as important a role. You can greatly improve your odds of beating your genetics by living right.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Being_Overweight\">2. Being Overweight<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Obesity contributes a whopping 80-85% to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. One of the mechanisms best understood for how being obese contributes to diabetes involves having too much abdominal fat, which leads to an \u201con fire\u201d or inflamed state of your body. You can read more on this process later in this article. It is for this very reason that weight loss is one of the most effective ways of reducing diabetes risk and if you are already diabetic, of improving your diabetes control.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Having_High_Blood_Pressure_or_Cholesterol\">3. Having High Blood Pressure or Cholesterol<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>&#8230; are factors that contribute to the phenomenon called Metabolic Syndrome that is thought of as being the precursor to diabetes. There are several <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/symptoms-of-prediabetes\/\">names and symptoms associated<\/a> with this state.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"4_Prescription_Medications\">4. Prescription Medications<\/span><\/h3>\n<div class=\"csColumnGap\">\n<div id=\"attachment_18759\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Causes-of-Diabetes.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18759\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18759\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Causes-of-Diabetes.webp\" alt=\"Prescribed medicine may be a risk associated with Diabetes \" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18759\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Prescribed medicine may be a risk associated with Diabetes<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"csColumn\" data-csstartpoint=\"15\" data-csendpoint=\"472.5\" data-cswidth=\"47.7%\" data-csid=\"c6bef1d2-1f9a-c453-827b-f16c57ffca4f\">\n<p>Unfortunately, the medications that we take to save ourselves from other diseases may, if continued for a medium to long term, result in us developing Type 2 Diabetes. These medications include beta blockers and thiazides (Blood pressure lowering medications), corticosteroids (used for autoimmune diseases like asthma, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/arthritis\/symptoms-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\/\">rheumatoid arthritis<\/a>, etc.) and statins (cholesterol-lowering medications)<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"5_Gestational_Diabetes\">5. Gestational Diabetes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a woman, this is relevant to you. If you suffered from diabetes during your pregnancy, it is called gestational diabetes and this can increase the risk of you developing Type 2 diabetes later in your life. There are some other medical conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS that can be<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/early-signs-of-diabetes-in-women\/\"> early indicators of diabetes<\/a> that women should pay special attention to.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What_happens_In_Your_Body_Before_You_Get_Diabetes\"><span id=\"What_Happens_In_Your_Body_Before_You_Get_Diabetes\">What Happens In Your Body Before You Get Diabetes?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Scientists are now saying that your body may be \u201con fire\u201d for years before you develop diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s break that statement down. Inflammation is the body\u2019s repair response to damage or attack. It involves white blood cells and chemicals being mobilized to reach areas that need help. Like in the outside world, all response to attack is itself destructive in some way, so it should not go on infinitely.<\/p>\n<p>Too much sugar is seen by the body as damaging. Once the damage is repaired the forces should withdraw, and the body should go back to homeostasis, or its \u201cpeaceful time.\u201d But\u00a0for some reason, in chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes, the inflamed state continues for too long. Here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Sugar_And_Insulin_A_Delicate_Dance\"><span id=\"Sugar_And_Insulin_A_Delicate_Dance\">Sugar And Insulin: A Delicate Dance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Sugar is a necessary evil. It is needed for energy production in the body, and insulin is the key keeper that escorts sugar into your muscle cells for this purpose. But sugar is also inflammatory, so cells are very sensitive to how much they can handle in one go. Sugar can harm our cells, if there\u2019s too much floating around at any given time.<\/p>\n<p>When there\u2019s too much sugar floating in the blood after a meal, (you ate that hi-carb meal, washed it down with a soda and went back to slump into your chair in front of the computer) the cells refuse to let insulin bring the extra sugar in. The result? Insulin production shoots up as the body tries to \u201cmuscle\u201d the sugar into the cells. When the muscle cells don\u2019t budge, excess sugar goes away into the fat cells, where it begins to accumulate.<\/p>\n<p>Now stay with us for a moment here\u2026 this is where the plot thickens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Insulin is itself inflammatory; that\u2019s why too much of it, for too long, is bad.<\/strong> The body is meant to only have high amounts of it for short periods of time, after meals, to help push sugar into cells. After that, it is meant to go down nicely.<\/p>\n<p>For reasons not yet clear to scientists, the fat cells don\u2019t like insulin much either, and in their insulin-irritated state, they tend to have a\u00a0nasty reaction to infections. So when we catch an infection (we all get the sniffles once in a while\u2026 or worse) the stage is set for the perfect storm.<\/p>\n<p>The already irritated fat cells react badly to the infection, causing a disproportionate inflammatory (immune) reaction. And in this state, when insulin comes along every successive day, carrying more sugar to be stored, the fat cells freak out. They begin to stay inflamed like someone was stoking the fire all day long causes of type 2 diabetes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Too much sugar = too much insulin = constant low-grade inflammation = diabetes in the long run.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This can cause serious damage to everything, including your brain. Citing a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. David Perlmutter, M.D., notes,\u00a0\u201cThere is a significantly increased risk for cognitive decline with mild elevations of blood sugar, well below levels that would indicate diabetes.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Adding_Fuel_to_The_Fire\"><span id=\"Adding_Fuel_to_The_Fire\">Adding Fuel to The Fire<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Now multiply this by the number of times you do the things that also feed inflammation in the body: eat processed foods with tons of simple sugars, drink more than you should, stay stressed, don\u2019t exercise, don\u2019t sleep well, take inflammatory prescription meds\u2026you get the idea. You keep stoking the fire until you have full-blown diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Now you get full blown\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/symptoms-of-diabetes-type-2\/\">symptoms of diabetes:<\/a> feel tired all day (no sugar in the cells = no energy production, but they are too scared to let the sugar in), and you\u2019re thirsty all the time (water is squeezed out of the cells to keep the corrosive sugar diluted in your blood, so you need more water). What\u2019s more, none of your delicate organs like blood laden with sugar, so you may develop eye problems (diabetic retina damage), heart problems (congestive heart disease, or CHD), and tingling\/burning sensations in your arms and feet (fine nerves are injured by high blood sugar too). These are the various complicated <strong>causes of type 2 diabetes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cWhen you spike your blood sugar level several times a day, every day, it is exactly like taking sandpaper to the inside of your delicate blood vessels,\u201d says Dr. Dwight Lundell, M.D, world-renowned heart surgeon.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"How_to_Put_Out_The_Fire\"><span id=\"How_to_Put_Out_The_Fire\">How to Put Out The Fire<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>While this is a highly simplified explanation, it\u2019s clear that inflammation is what we want to reduce for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/can-diabetes-be-prevented\/\">type 2 diabetes prevention<\/a>.
