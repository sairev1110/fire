She wonders when the others will notice that she is literally burning up. Can they see it? Did it suddenly get hot in here, or is it just her?

Hot flashes can often be at the top of the list of these symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With\nmenopause, women begin to have lower levels of the hormone estrogen. And while\nscience still doesn\u2019t have a definitive answer as to \u2018why\u2019 women get hot\nflashes, they are a common symptom of perimenopause as well as menopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a closer look at what exactly these hot flashes causes are, and what you can do to reduce the severity of this pesky symptom of menopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_Is_a_Hot_Flash\"><strong>What Is a Hot Flash?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/What-Is-a-Hot-Flash.webp\" alt=\"Menopause Hot Flashes Causes Natural Treatment\" class=\"wp-image-21165\"\/><figcaption>What Is a Hot Flash<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/menopause\/what-are-symptoms-of-menopause-deal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">hot flash<\/a> is the sudden onset of intense heat, which is often unrelated to external factors. It\u2019s accompanied by sweat and sometimes a red, flushed face and\/or neck too. Sometimes they happen while you\u2019re asleep, and are known as night sweats as well.<br><br>Some common symptoms of hot flashes are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Face and neck becoming flushed<\/li><li>Sweating, particularly above the chest<\/li><li>Chills<\/li><li>Skin feeling warm, even when it\u2019s not warm outside<\/li><li>Faster heart beat<\/li><li> Tingling in fingers <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_Causes_Hot_Flashes\"><strong>What Causes Hot Flashes?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/What-Causes-Hot-Flashes.webp\" alt=\"Menopause Hot Flashes Causes Natural Treatment\" class=\"wp-image-21167\"\/><figcaption>What Causes Hot Flashes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Science has been unable to pinpoint the exact cause behind hot flashes, but they are closely linked to hormonal fluctuations, which is why they\u2019re so common in perimenopause and menopausal women. Changing hormone levels affects circulation, causing blood vessels closest to the skin to widen in an attempt to cool off. This is what causes the flushing and sweating.<br><br>Let\u2019s get into the science of it, shall we?<br><br>The hypothalamus is the part of the brain that acts as the master control of our body temperature. Think of it as our main temperature control unit. It has a \u201cnull\u201d zone which is 0.4 degrees centigrade wide, and the function of this zone is to ensure that small changes in external environment don\u2019t throw off your core body temperature. For example if the temperature raises or drops by a few degrees, this main control unit ensures our body doesn\u2019t resort to extreme reactions &#8211; like vasodilation or constriction of arteries and veins \u2013 which can cause chills, shivers or profuse sweating. <br><br>Around menopause, this thermo-regulatory center seems to go through a fundamental change, leading to a loss of sensitivity to this null zone. This is why even small changes in external factors \u2013 like heat, cold, stress, etc. lead to the body having an extreme reaction to try and correct for the external stimulus. <br><br>A comprehensive 2014 research paper called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4612529\/#R55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Menopausal Hot Flashes: Mechanisms, Endocrinology, Treatment by Robert R. Freedman, Ph.D<\/a> proposed that this mechanism of loss of sensitivity was caused by hormonal changes that a woman undergoes during menopause. There\u2019s an increase in the levels of the neurotransmitter Norepinephrine (also known as \u2018Stress Hormone\u2019) in the hypothalamus, which in turn is caused by lower levels of oestrogen in menopausal women. Together, these hormonal fluctuations lead to a narrowing of the null zone. <br><br>Serotonin was proposed to have the ability to reduce the effects of norepinephrine, thereby lowering hot flashes. That is why anti-depressants, that have serotonin like effects, are sometimes prescribed by allopathic doctors to menopausal women, even in the absence of regular depression symptoms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Who_Is_Susceptible_To_Hot_Flashes\"><strong>Who Is Susceptible To Hot Flashes?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hot Flashes can start suddenly, and are seen in women with menopause and perimenopause as well. Perimenopause is the period before the inset of menopause and can last anywhere from 4 to 7 years, before your periods stop completely.<br><br>Sometimes hot flashes are also seen in women who undergo hysterectomy, oophorectomy or chemotherapy, because these medical procedures interfere with your hormones, mainly with oestrogen.<br><br>However, some women never get hot flashes, while others can experience them for more than 11 years. Lifestyle factors that affect hormones can sometimes worsen hot flashes. This is why women with metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2 and those who are obese may experience them more often. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"How_Long_Do_Hot_Flashes_Last\"><strong>How Long Do Hot Flashes Last?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to define how long hot flashes last. Since they are intrinsically linked to hormonal fluctuations, they vary from one woman to another. <br><br>For some women, a hot flash may pass in just a few minutes, while others can have episodes lasting 10 minutes or more. The frequency of hot flashes is also dependent on your individual hormonal fluctuations. Some women can experience several hot flashes in an hour, while others have a few per week. <br><br>For some women, hot flashes are nothing but as minor annoyance, while for others, the severity and intensity can negatively affect quality of life. <br><br>How long hot flashes last is dependent on how wildly your hormones are fluctuating during perimenopause or menopause, which is why lifestyle changes and modifications that aim to help stabilize hormones are the key to easy transitioning to menopausal life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_Are_Some_Common_Triggers\"><strong>What Are Some Common Triggers<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each woman\u2019s hormones have a delicate balance of their own, which is why triggers vary from one woman to the next. However, some common triggers for hot flashes are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stress or Anxiety<\/li><li>Being in hot temperatures<\/li><li>Wearing tight, restrictive clothing<\/li><li>Caffeine intake<\/li><li>Smoking<\/li><li>Drinking alcohol<\/li><li>Eating spicy foods<\/li><li>Bending over suddenly<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to identify your triggers, as this can help make hot flashes less frequent and\/or severe. While it is not possible to prevent hot flashes completely during menopause, avoiding or controlling your triggers will go a long way towards improving your quality of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Conventional_Treatment_And_Their_Downsides\"><strong>Conventional Treatment And Their Downsides<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Conventional-Treatment-And-Their-Downsides.webp\" alt=\"Menopause Hot Flashes Causes Natural Treatment\" class=\"wp-image-21168\"\/><figcaption>Conventional Treatment And Their Downsides<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) was the conventional treatment for all menopause related symptoms, but their popularity has waned in recent times. Many women who tried HRT using synthetic hormones found that their hot flashes and other symptoms returned the minute they stopped using artificial hormones. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>HRT cannot be used for women who have had breast\/uterine\/endometrial cancer in the past. In fact, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/europepmc.org\/abstract\/med\/10695959\" target=\"_blank\">studies<\/a> find that HRT could also raise risk of cancer in people without a past history of cancer. And don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that estrogen-only HRT is the only evil.&nbsp; <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jnci\/article\/92\/4\/328\/2624742\" target=\"_blank\">Research<\/a> finds strong evidence that the addition of a progestin to HRT markedly enhances the risk of breast cancer as well. <br><br>However, cancer is not the only downside of HRT. Using artificial hormones to treat symptoms of menopause have also been <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/ije\/article\/30\/3\/423\/736896\" target=\"_blank\">scientifically linked<\/a> with increased risk for memory loss and dementia, urinary incontinence, blot clots, incidences of heart attack and stroke, osteoporosis, venous thromboembolic disease, as well as ineffective mammograms for breast-cancer detection. <br><br>Bio-identical hormones, derived entirely from plants, have emerged as a strong alternative to synthetic HRT, but people still worry about having to take external hormones due to the association with earlier HRT. All things considered, natural, alternative, safe therapies as well as lifestyle modifications can be a very effective way to treat hot flashes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"6_Natural_Solutions_To_Minimize_Hot_Flashes\"><strong>6 Natural Solutions To Minimize Hot Flashes<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While hot flashes are a part and parcel of life with menopause, there are several steps you can take to reduce their severity and intensity. Alternate therapies and lifestyle modifications don\u2019t just help hot flashes, they also help minimize other annoying symptoms of menopause (like low libido, fatigue, weight gain and more) as you become healthier, fitter and better able to transition to menopausal life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Practice_Mindfulness\"><strong>Practice Mindfulness<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stress releases epinephrine \u2013 a hormone that increases core body temperature and causes sweating. Practicing mindfulness using relaxing techniques goes a long way towards decreasing frequency and severity of hot flashes.<br><br>Make some \u201cme\u201d time for yourself every day. Sit down and relax with a cup of tea and do things that help calm your mind \u2013 be it listening to music, reading a good book or simply enjoying your beautiful garden. Remember, the onset of a hot flash can trigger anxiety, intensifying your symptoms. Calming techniques come very handy to keep stress at bay and make living with menopause a lot easier.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some relaxing techniques worth trying are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"176\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Practice-Mindfulness.webp\" alt=\"Menopause Hot Flashes Causes Natural Treatment\" class=\"wp-image-21171\"\/><figcaption>Practice Mindfulness<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Deep breathing exercises<\/li><li>Yoga<\/li><li>Meditation<\/li><li>Acupuncture<\/li><li>Massage<\/li><li>Talk therapies with a counsellor or even a close confidant<\/li><li>Guided thought<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Identify_Your_Triggers\"><strong>Identify Your Triggers<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since triggers for menopause vary from woman to woman, it is worth identifying your personal triggers. And then making conscious efforts to avoid or minimize them. <br><br>Here are some tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Quit smoking today. If someone else smokes in your family, avoid exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke as well.<\/li><li>If you cannot give up drinking completely, it\u2019s wise to cut back as much as possible.<\/li><li>Avoid wearing tight, form-fitting clothes. Instead, opt for flowy silhouettes that allow better circulation and choose natural fabrics that breathe more easily. Make sure your first layer of clothing is cotton, even in winter. <\/li><li>If you experience night sweats, it\u2019s a good idea to change bed linen to cotton. While silks and satin fabrics feel soft against the body, these don\u2019t breathe easily, making you more likely to wake up from the sweating. <\/li><li>If you notice that your hot flashes worsen on a hot day, plan to stay indoors where it\u2019s cooler. Handheld fans do a great job of cooling you off in case you start sweating profusely and can\u2019t get into air-conditioned indoors immediately. You can also carry a bottle of cool   water with you at all times. Hydrate when you start to heat up and splash some cold water on your face and neck for some immediate relief. <\/li><li>Lose weight, as hot flashes are more common in overweight women. Not only will weight loss help improve your health markers; it will also reduce frequency and intensity of hot flashes. Follow a healthier diet and try gentle exercises to drop the weight.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Eat_Right\"><strong>Eat Right<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img width=\"365\" height=\"176\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Eat-Right.webp\" alt=\"Menopause Hot Flashes Causes Natural Treatment\" class=\"wp-image-21172\"\/><figcaption>Eat Right<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We cannot stress on this enough \u2013 you are what you eat. Eating a nutrient-dense, balanced diet that comprises of healthy fats and proteins helps stabilize hormones, which greatly improves all menopause symptoms like hot flashes.<br><br>Give up on highly refined, sugar-loaded foods and instead opt for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Healthy Carbs <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ditch white bread, rice and pasta, and instead opt for healthier carbs\nlike lots of green, fibrous vegetables, fruits and whole grains<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Healthy Fats <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids like fish, seafood, avocado,\nseeds and nuts. Replace generic refined cooking oils with grass-fed ghee,\nbutter, cold-pressed coconut oil and olive oil, as these healthy fats improve\ninsulin sensitivity, boost heart health and also stabilize hormones. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Healthy Proteins <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opt for lean cuts of meats, eggs, chicken and turkey, fish and seafood and give up on processed meats and cold cuts like bacon, sausages, salamis and fried snacks. Lentils and legumes are other good sources of protein for vegetarians. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Foods_to_Avoid_in_Hot_Flashes\"><strong>Foods to Avoid in Hot Flashes<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Foods-to-Avoid-in-Hot-Flashes.webp\" alt=\"Menopause Hot Flashes Causes Natural Treatment\" class=\"wp-image-21173\"\/><figcaption>Foods to Avoid in Hot Flashes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the\nother hand, some foods are known to worsen hot flashes and are best avoided. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spicy foods <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These increase body temperature, triggering hot flashes.
