And this saliva, in turn, lubricates our digestive system. Saliva also contains important electrolytes and enzymes which are beneficial to our body. If you are getting acid reflux in the morning, this could be because you\u2019re not swallowing during your sleep. When you rise in the morning, you experience much worse symptoms than you do during the day. Because stomach acid can sit in the esophagus without saliva helping out. This can be very frustrating. However, there are a few techniques that will help to alleviate your symptoms.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"3_Tips_To_Minimize_Acid_Reflux_In_The_Morning\">3 Tips To Minimize Acid Reflux In The Morning<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Sleep_With_Your_Head_Elevated\">Sleep With Your Head Elevated<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Studies show that <em>head of bed<\/em> is effective in reducing acid reflux. This is especially true for those who experience greater symptoms at night time and early morning. Try placing more pillows underneath your head. You can also try keeping blocks under the top of your bed for elevation. The idea is to keep your head more elevated than your stomach. Because of this elevation, stomach acid doesn\u2019t travel up your esophagus while you\u2019re sleeping.<\/p>\n<p>Doctors will recommend head of bed as beneficial, due to the effect of gravity. Patients who have tried this approach have reported:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Significantly fewer and shorter reflux episodes<\/li>\n<li>Faster acid clearing<\/li>\n<li>Fewer reflux symptoms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This remedy helps you to get sound sleep. It is also a great preventative measure to avoid waking up with a burning pain in your esophagus.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Eat_Smaller_Portions_at_Dinner\">Eat Smaller Portions at Dinner<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Keep a close eye on the portion size of your last meal of the day. Also, keep a tab on the time in which you eat before sleeping. You will probably notice changes in your reflux symptoms upon waking. To prevent this, try to allow at least three hours for your food to digest before going to bed.<\/p>\n<p>Often, acid reflux is a result of a faulty lower esophageal sphincter (LES). LES is the valve that sits at the bottom of your esophagus. In normal function, the LES opens and closes when swallowing food or belching. However, it should remain closed at all other times.<\/p>\n<p>Going to bed on a full stomach can only aggravate an abnormal LES. This happens especially if you sleep in a flat position. Therefore, combining the head of bed remedy will assist. Because\u00a0during the day your body normally has a lot more time to digest food, in a natural and upright position.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Drink_Lemon_Water_When_Waking\">Drink Lemon Water When Waking<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s important to rehydrate when you wake up. That&#8217;s because a dry throat can often make symptoms of acid reflux even worse. Water is a great option as it is alkaline. It has a positive effect in balancing out the powerful acidity contained in stomach acid.Drinking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/lemon-for-acid-reflux\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">lemon water<\/a>\u00a0helps with reflux symptoms.
