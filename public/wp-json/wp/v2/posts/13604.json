For those who don\u2019t, they are substances that disrupt the production of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/hypothyroidism\/eat-your-way-to-thyroid-health\/\">thyroid <\/a>hormone. They do so by creating problems in the absorption\u00a0of iodine in the thyroid gland.<\/p>\n<h2>Goitrogenic Foods And Thyroid: Understand The Connection<\/h2>\n<p>Too much of goitrogens in your system can create a\u00a0disorder in your thyroid gland. The thyroid gland grows\u00a0more cells to compensate for inadequate hormone production. Eventually, this leads to goiter.\u00a0Excess goitrogens also\u00a0restrict\u00a0the production of hormones that are responsible for controlling metabolism.<\/p>\n<p>However, contrary to common belief, consumption of goitrogenic foods is not the most common cause of goiter.\u00a0Thyroid patients are often recommended to consume goitrogenic foods, because these foods are rich in vitamins and minerals.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to eat these foods in the right way rather than avoiding them completely. We have included below a list of\u00a0goitrogenic foods.\u00a0Cooking, steaming or fermentation of these foods can lessen their goitrogenic properties to a large extent, while also giving health benefits.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brussels sprouts<\/li>\n<li>Cabbage<\/li>\n<li>Cassava root<\/li>\n<li>Mustard greens<\/li>\n<li>Broccoli<\/li>\n<li>Kale<\/li>\n<li>Spinach<\/li>\n<li>Peanuts<\/li>\n<li>Soy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Soy is another product to be consumed with caution. Cooking soy partially reduces its goitrogenic activity. \u00a0So, it&#8217;s advisable to opt for fermented or cultured soy products such as miso, soy sauce etc. Whole soybean foods such as tofu should be consumed only after steaming or cooking.<\/p>\n<p>Having goitrogenic\u00a0foods in minimal doses (after steaming or cooking) would mean you are not entirely deprived of the nutrients in them. Also, this way, their goitrogenic activity may be minimal or nil, so\u00a0it won\u2019t be enough to harm you. Many of the goitrogenic foods\u00a0are highly beneficial and nutritional to the body, especially the ones rich in phytochemicals (except in the case of auto-immune syndrome). So it is advisable to have them in adequate doses.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Goitrogens is a familiar term for patients suffering from goiter or abnormal growth of thyroid hormones.
