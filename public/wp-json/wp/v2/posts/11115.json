Think again! The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of exercise a week for adults, which is of moderate intensity.\u00a0Sadly,\u00a0many of us are not able to make time for workouts in our busy schedules during the weekdays. Here&#8217;s some good news.\u00a0Exercising on weekends can be as effective as exercising on weekdays.<\/p>\n<h2>Is Weekend Exercise Beneficial?<\/h2>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/article-abstract\/2596007\">study <\/a>carried out by researchers from the University of Leicester, Loughborough University, University College London and the University of Sydney, it was concluded that the duration and the frequency of exercise did not affect those respondents who were frequently active. What mattered was whether the respondents had sufficient exercise of a minimum of 150 minutes a week.<\/p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/apnm-2013-0049#.WSjeKmiGPIU\">study <\/a>carried out by researchers from Queen\u2019s University came to a similar conclusion that the important part is to get 150 minutes of exercise. Choosing when to do this really did not matter. The respondents who did not perform any exercise between Monday to Friday but were active for 150 minutes over the weekend, had the same health benefits as those who accumulated 150 minutes of physical activity over the entire week.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does Exercise Help In Managing Chronic Illnesses?<\/h2>\n<p>Regular physical activity helps manage the symptoms of chronic illnesses and often improves the overall health of the body. Different forms of exercises such as aerobics, flexibility exercises and\/or strength training aid in weight loss. It also helps in\u00a0increasing endurance, improving muscle strength, and promoting heart health. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, asthma, diabetes, arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome and back pain can be managed better with exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Studies indicate that being physically active in the 30s, 40s, and 50s can extend the lifespan and increase the chances of aging healthily. Such a lifestyle can also lower\u00a0the risks of chronic illnesses in the later years of life.<\/p>\n<p>To summarize, what is important is to work out for at least 150 minutes a week, whenever you find the time \u2013 weekend or weekdays. The frequency does not matter; the overall amount of physical activity does!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many of us are not able to make time in our busy schedules during the weekdays.
