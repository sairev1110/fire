This is how many ounces of water you will need to drink each day. Before drinking the water, allow 1\/8th teaspoon of unprocessed sea salt to dissolve in the mouth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When To Have:<\/strong> Divide your daily dosage of water into 5-8 manageable doses throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What form:<\/strong>\u00a0The best is unprocessed sea salt or unprocessed mined salt.

As a natural antibiotic, garlic is a natural way to kill the H.pylori bacteria that affects almost 80% of reflux sufferers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s the best way to use garlic to cure acid reflux.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dosage: <\/strong>2 cloves of minced raw garlic, or 2 capsules of garlic supplements<\/p>\n<p><strong>When To Have: <\/strong>On an empty stomach<\/p>\n<p><strong>What form:<\/strong>\u00a0Choose fresh garlic that is not yet sprouted.

In fact, IBS is also common in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, which might be a byproduct of the disproportionate use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in IBS. Studies have found that H. pylori related gastritis and reflux esophagitis progress negatively under treatment with\u00a0PPIs like omeprazole. This is where Saccharomyces boulardii, a probiotic strain specifically for the small intestine, steps in. This probiotic can reduce H.pylori infections, as well as prevent gastric ulcerations. It also helps reduce gut inflammation and improves the body\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients from the food that you eat, making this the perfect acid reflux home remedy available today.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As advised by Chris Kresser, a Renowned Practitioner of Functional Medicine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dosage: <\/strong>500mg, twice a day<\/p>\n<p><strong>When To Have: <\/strong>After meals<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Form: <\/strong>Though it\u2019s also available in liquid and powder form, capsules provide the most accurate dose that is also easy to take every day.<\/p>\n<p>While these unusual and surprising remedies for acid reflux are worth trying, they cannot replace conventional treatment for GERD.
