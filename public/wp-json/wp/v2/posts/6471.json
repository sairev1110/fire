In 2011, diabetes caused nearly 44% of kidney failure cases. This makes diabetic kidney disease the Number One complication of diabetes; one that is likely to affect almost every diabetic to some extent. In nearly half the cases of kidney disease, it could lead to kidney failure as well.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Diabetes_and_Kidneys\"><span id=\"Diabetes_and_Kidney_Damage\">Diabetes and Kidney Damage<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The kidneys filter nearly 200 quarts of our blood every day. Diabetes is a disease of excess sugar in our blood. Read these two sentences together and the link between diabetes and kidneys becomes obvious!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Every single day of our lives, the kidneys perform these functions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove waste from our body (in the form of urine)<\/li>\n<li>Retain whatever proteins, vitamins and other nutrients we can still use<\/li>\n<li>Balance the fluids in the body<\/li>\n<li>Help maintain proper blood pressure by managing potassium and calcium levels<\/li>\n<li>Keep bones healthy<\/li>\n<li>Help make red blood cells.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Diabetes damages the kidneys and the urinary system in three main ways:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Damage to blood vessels in the kidneys: Too much sugar damages the filters in the kidneys<\/li>\n<li>Damage to nerves: Fine nerves in the hands, feet, etc. are corroded by the extra sugar in the blood<\/li>\n<li>Damage to the urinary tract: Nerves run from our bladder to our brain and let us know when the bladder is full and we need to go. Damage to these nerves could mean we don\u2019t react when our bladder is full. Result: extra pressure on the kidneys. Retained urine can also allow urinary tract infections to grow and migrate back to the kidneys.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Diabetes damage to blood vessels inside kidneys:<\/strong> The filtering units of the kidneys are called glomeruli\u00a0(sing. \u2013 glomerulus). They have tiny blood vessels that are easily clogged and damaged by excess sugar in our blood. Damage to these vessels also causes albumin, a kind of protein to leak via the urine. Ideally, albumin should be retained in the body. It is a condition called microalbuminuria in the early stages and albuminuria in the later stages. This condition is generally called proteinuria where proteins are found in the urine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diabetes damage to nerves:<\/strong> Diabetes can also damage nerves everywhere in the body, a condition that is called diabetic neuropathy. When this happens in our hands and feet, we lose sensation there or begin to feel \u2018pins and needles\u2019. Nerves also convey messages from the brain to the urinary bladder and back. They inform the brain when our bladder is full. However, when these nerves are damaged by excess blood sugar, the brain does not realize when the bladder is full. The pressure from a full bladder can damage our kidneys over time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diabetes damage to urinary tract damage:<\/strong> When urine is retained in the bladder for long, the risk of bacterial infections increases. Bacteria also thrive on sugar, so diabetes increases infection risk. These infections usually stay limited to the urinary bladder. However, if they last for long, they may migrate to the kidneys and damage them too.<\/p>\n<p>Consider all this in an organ that is working 24&#215;7. Now you see why diabetic kidney failure is such a real danger for diabetics over the long term.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Diabetic_Kidney_Failure_Early_Stages_and_Symptoms\"><span id=\"Diabetic_Kidney_Failure_Early_Stages\">Diabetic Kidney Failure: Early Stages<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18984\" style=\"width: 1771px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/diabetic-nephropathy-scaled.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18984\" class=\"wp-image-18984 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/diabetic-nephropathy-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Diabetic Kidney Failure: Early Stages\" width=\"1761\" height=\"2560\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18984\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diabetic Kidney Failure: Early Stages<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Diabetic kidney failure is a very real threat. It is a slow but relentless process that is divided into <a href=\"https:\/\/nccd.cdc.gov\/ckd\/help.aspx?section=F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">five stages<\/a> of deterioration. The last stage called Diabetic Kidney Failure or End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)<\/p>\n<p><strong>The 5 stages of Diabetic Kidney Failure are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 1:<\/strong> Kidney damage with normal GFR (90 or more). GFR or Glomeruler Filtration Rate is the most widely accepted measure of kidney function. It is a measure of how much blood passes through all the glomeruli per minute. It is measured in milliliters\/minute\/1.73 m<sup>2<\/sup>. There are often no symptoms at this stage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage 2:<\/strong> Kidney damage with mild decrease in GFR (60 to 89). Again, most patients feel no specific symptoms till this point.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage 3:<\/strong> Moderate decrease in GFR (30 to 59). At this stage, you may be losing too much protein, calcium and other nutrients. Some patients may feel breathless (due to loss of iron and anemia). Some puffiness and water retention could also be visible in the body. Urine may turn brown in color. Some patients feel back pain too.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage 4:<\/strong> Severe reduction in GFR (15 to 29). All of the symptoms of Stage 3 will are felt even more acutely\u00a0 now. Some blood may be seen in the urine. Breathlessness and swelling are usually quite severe. The stage at which you will need to finalize dialysis or kidney transplant options.\u00a0Dialysis is a clinical purification of blood by an instrument called a \u201cdialysis machine\u201d when kidneys fail to perform their functions effectively.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage 5:<\/strong> Kidney failure (GFR less than 15). The kidneys give up at this stage. You will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Symptoms_of_Kidney_Disease_in_Diabetic_Patients\">Symptoms of Kidney Disease in Diabetic Patients<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Frequent urination, especially at night<\/li>\n<li>Blood or other dark discharge in the urine<\/li>\n<li>Swelling in the ankles<\/li>\n<li>Cramps in the calf muscles of the legs<\/li>\n<li>Feeling sick, feeling like throwing up, first thing in the morning<\/li>\n<li>Feeling weak, tired, breathless, looking pale<\/li>\n<li>Unexplained and consistent high blood pressure<\/li>\n<li>Unexplained urge to itch<\/li>\n<li>Lab tests: Protein or albumin in the urine<\/li>\n<li>Lab tests: Higher than normal levels of creatinine or BUN in the blood<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Risk_Factors_for_Diabetic_Nephropathy\">Risk Factors for Diabetic Nephropathy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Risk factors for the\u00a0development of diabetic nephropathy include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hyperglycemia<\/li>\n<li>Hypertension<\/li>\n<li>Family history of hyperglycemia and hypertension<\/li>\n<li>Smoking<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"Diabetes_and_Kidneys_How_to_Protect_Yourself\"><span id=\"Diabetes_and_Kidneys_How_to_Protect_Yourself\">Diabetes and Kidneys: How to Protect Yourself<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>First, you doctor needs to be sure that the underlying diabetes is the main cause of the kidney damage. Once this is done, the standard approach is to keep the kidneys working well for as long as possible. You doctor will likely add the hypertension-reducing medications called Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to your regimen. This is because ACE inhibitors have been shown to help slow the loss of kidney function.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s what diabetics can do to protect themselves from kidney damage:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Control your blood sugar better.<\/strong> Don&#8217;t rely only on medications, but make changes to diet and lifestyle too. Many doctors endorse intermittent fasting to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/can-you-reverse-type-2-diabetes\/\">reverse diabetes<\/a> today.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Control high blood pressure.<\/strong> Take prescribed medicines on time. Daily moderate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/how-does-exercise-help-diabetes\/\">exercise<\/a> and stress management techniques like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/stress-meditation-type-2-diabetes\/\">meditation <\/a>can help too.<\/li>\n<li>Watch out for and get timely treatment for <strong>urinary tract infections<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Involve your doctor on medication:<\/strong> Don\u2019t take medications like over-the-counter pain medications without telling your doctor. These may damage the kidneys, especially if you\u2019re already at risk.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Watch out for and take steps to prevent diabetic neuropathy.<\/strong> Damaged urinary tract nerves can lead to urinary retention and kidney damage. Some drugs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/metformin-side-effects\/\">metformin <\/a>can contribute to diabetic nerve damage and supplements like Vitamin B12 (as part of a good <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/vitamins-for-diabetics\/\">Vitamin B Complex <\/a>) and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/what-does-alpha-lipoic-acid-do\/\"> Alpha Lipoic Acid <\/a>can help prevent this. Be aware and act soon.<\/li>\n<li>For people with diabetes, <strong>kidney screening once a year is mandatory.<\/strong> This can help to detect any protein or other substances that shouldn\u2019t normally be in the urine.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use the right dietary supplements<\/strong> to protect your kidneys from diabetes damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"Diabetic_Nephropathy_Dietary_Supplements_That_Help\"><span id=\"Diabetic_Nephropathy_Dietary_Supplements_That_Help\">Diabetic Nephropathy: Dietary Supplements That Help<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"Vitamin_C_200mg-_1250mg_per_day\"><span id=\"Vitamin_C_200mg-_1250mg_per_day\">Vitamin C (200mg- 1250mg per day)<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18986\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Vitamin-C.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18986\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18986\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Vitamin-C.webp\" alt=\"Manage Diabetes Nephropathy with Vitamin C\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18986\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Manage Diabetes Nephropathy with Vitamin C<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Vitamin C is known to reduce excretion of urinary albumin.
