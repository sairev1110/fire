Ayurvedic kitchen medicines, used safely for centuries, can provide a better option for managing PCOS symptoms. Ayurvedic herbs, which should always be taken under the care of a qualified medical practitioner, can also produce amazing results in those suffering from PCOD for a long time.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Why_Should_Women_Prefer_Ayurvedic_Treatment_For_Pcos\"><strong>Why Should Women Prefer Ayurvedic Treatment For Pcos?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Ayurveda, PCOD can be correlated with hypomenorrhea (extremely light menstrual blood flow), oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstrual periods), heavy periods and symptoms of high male hormones, like cystic acne and excess facial and body hair. Modern management of PCOS focusses on lowering insulin resistance (a common condition in PCOS) and using medicines to control elevated male hormone levels. Women who are overweight are also advised to lose weight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOS is a lifestyle disease; improper diet, sedentary lifestyle and not actively managing day-to-day stress are all factors that make it worse. These can be addressed very well with the use of simple Ayurvedic kitchen medicines to begin with. More complex PCOS cases can be addressed with the following ayurvedic remedies, as prescribed by an Ayurvedic practitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Ayurvedic_Herbs\"><strong>Ayurvedic Herbs<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The principle behind Ayurvedic treatment is to normalize metabolism, balance the hormones and regulate the menstrual system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Triphala Kwatha, Chandraprabha Vati<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Manibhadra Choorna<\/em>&nbsp;help to clear the obstruction of fluids in the body and normalize the&nbsp;<em>srotas <\/em>or vessels that carry the flow of bodily fluids. <em>Triphala<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Guggulu<\/em> especially are very useful for reducing excess weight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powder of&nbsp;<em>A. racemosus<\/em>&nbsp;(<em>Shatavari<\/em>) brings balance and strength to the menstrual system and it helps to regulate menstrual cycles. It is used in females who get their menstruation but are not able to conceive. Hence, the use of Shatavari enhances the chances of conception.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powder of seeds of&nbsp;<em>P. graveloens<\/em>, oil of&nbsp;<em>Krishna Jeeraka<\/em>&nbsp;(Nigella sativa) and oil of&nbsp;<em>Sahachara<\/em>&nbsp;(<em>Barleria prionits<\/em>) are helpful in removing harmful cysts on ovaries and stimulate the follicular maturity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Ocimum tenuiflorum<\/strong><\/em><strong> (Holy Basil):&nbsp;<\/strong> It has got excellent anti-androgenic properties for decreasing the excess male hormone production. It is also a promising remedy for the management of obesity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Actaea racemosa<\/strong><\/em><strong> (Black Cohosh):<\/strong> It has the ability to induce ovulation in women with PCOS. It is also renowned as a women\u2019s remedy associated with complications related to childbearing and menstrual cycles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Areca catechu<\/strong><\/em><strong> (Betel Palm):<\/strong> It helps maintain the healthy production of female hormones and relieves the congestion of the blood vessels in the abdominal area. It also helps in maintaining a healthy female reproductive system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Galega officinalisi<\/strong><\/em><strong> (Goats Rue):<\/strong> It is the natural source of guanidine which is an anti-diabetic drug from <em>biguanides <\/em>class. Therefore, it can be used as a substitute to Metformin which also belongs to biguanide class and is commonly prescribed for PCOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some other important herbs are <em>Ashoka (Saraka Indica), Manjistha (Rubia Cordifolia), Shalmali (Bombax Malbaricum), Lodhra (Symplocos Racemosus), Rasanjan (Barberis Chitra), Sariva (Hemidesmus Indicus), Gokshur (Tribulus Teristris), Punarnava (Boerrhavia Diffusa), Nagkeshar (Mesua Ferea), Chandan (Santalum Albam), Amalaki (Embelica Officinalis), Haridra (Curcuma Longa), Gudmar (Gymnema Sylvestre), Guduchi (Tinospora Cordifolia), Methi (Trigonella Foenum Gaecum), Vijaysar (Pterocarpus Marsupium) <\/em>that can help in managing PCOS when it comes to Ayurvedic treatment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The powders of these Ayurvedic drugs are quite beneficial in bringing balance and strength to the menstrual system and regulating menstrual cycles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Ayurvedic_Home_Remedies\">Ayurvedic Home Remedies:<br><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cumin and Fenugreek Remedy:<\/strong> Take a glass of water and let it come to a boil on the stove. Add one tsp of fenugreek (known as <em>methi<\/em> in north India and <em>vedhiyam <\/em>in south India). Add 1\/2 tsp of cumin (known as <em>jeera<\/em> in north India and as <em>jeerakam<\/em> in south India) to this. Turn the stove flame to simmer and let it boil for 15 minutes. Cool the liquid, strain it and drink it twice a day on an empty stomach. This remedy helps to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce excess testosterone (male hormone) caused by too much insulin.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Aloe Vera Remedy:<\/strong> Half a glass of pure aloe juice on an empty stomach once in the morning and another half glass in the evening can help to regularise periods.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Ginger Tea:<\/strong> You can make a simple ginger tea by taking a 2-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeling it, crushing it and simmering for 10 to 20 minutes with 1 1\/2 to 2 cups of water. Have it 2-3 times a day. This remedy can help onset of delayed periods, instead of having to resort to hormonal pills.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Sweet Potato Remedy:<\/strong> Include one sweet potato daily in your diet. You can boil it and make a chaat or salad out of it. Many women with PCOD can have periods that seem regular and normal, but when they attempt to get pregnant, they discover that one key feature of periods \u2013 ovulation \u2013 is not proper. This leads to a deficiency of a hormone called progesterone, without which no pregnancy is possible. Sweet Potato helps create progesterone. Since the same hormone is also responsible for regulating mood swings, excess acne, body hair, etc., it is a good addition for all women with PCOD.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOD can be reversed using a holistic approach.
