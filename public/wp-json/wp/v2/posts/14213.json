And that is just a beginning of your struggles. The good news is that PCOS and healthy pregnancy do not have to be mutually exclusive. With proper planning and good self-care, you too can have a healthy pregnancy and enjoy motherhood! But first, let&#8217;s understand the risks associated with PCOS and healthy pregnancy.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"PCOS_And_Healthy_Pregnancy_What_Are_The_Risks\"><strong>PCOS And Healthy Pregnancy: What Are The Risks?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Starting a family when you have PCOS can be a challenging time. You may also be worried about how PCOS affects healthy pregnancy. Studies have found that approximately 50-70% of all women with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) may have some degree of insulin resistance. This insulin resistance is often also the main cause of concern for PCOS and healthy pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p>A study was done in Norway to determine the\u00a0impact of insulin resistance on pregnancy complications in PCOS patients. The study found that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The frequency of hypertension was significantly elevated in PCOS women (around 11.5% more) compared to controls<\/li>\n<li>The frequency of pre-eclampsia was significantly elevated only in the insulin resistant PCOS women (around 13.5%) compared to controls. Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication that is marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine.<\/li>\n<li>Gestational diabetes was significantly more frequent in PCOS women (7.7% more) than controls<\/li>\n<li>Newborns from PCOS pregnancies were significantly more often delivered by Caesarean section than controls (40.3 vs. 27.3%.) Also, these newborns were transferred to neonatal intensive care unit more often than controls (19.2 vs. 9.0%.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Thus, scientists concluded that the risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes is elevated in PCOS pregnancies. PCOS can also have ramifications for newborns. It also increases the\u00a0risk of miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p>Published in Oxford Academia, <a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/humupd\/article\/12\/6\/673\/625165\/A-meta-analysis-of-pregnancy-outcomes-in-women\">scientists<\/a> conducted a meta-analysis of pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients. They found that these women were at an increased risk of pregnancy and neonatal complications. These included:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>High risk of developing gestational diabetes<\/li>\n<li>High risk of hypertension caused by pregnancy<\/li>\n<li>Higher risk of pre-eclampsia<\/li>\n<li>Higher risk of preterm birth<\/li>\n<li>Higher risk of perinatal mortality (deaths\u00a0in the\u00a0first week\u00a0of life and fetal\u00a0deaths\u00a0or stillbirths).<\/li>\n<li>Newborns have higher risk of being admitted to neonatal intensive care unit<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As you can see, there are some serious complications associated with PCOS and healthy pregnancy. To reduce these risks, it\u2019s crucial to get PCOS under control and prepare your body for pregnancy.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/getting-pregnant-with-pcos\/\">Getting Pregnant With PCOS: 5 Tips From An Expert<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"PCOS_And_Healthy_Pregnancy_6_Tips_to_Prepare_Your_Body\">PCOS And Healthy Pregnancy: 6 Tips to Prepare Your Body<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Diet and lifestyle choices can have a big impact on PCOS and healthy pregnancy, which is why you want to make the right choices.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Start_Eating_Well\">Start Eating Well<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_20564\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Start-Eating-Well.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20564\" class=\"wp-image-20564 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Start-Eating-Well.webp\" alt=\"pcos and healthy pregnancy\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20564\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Start Eating Well<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Changing your diet can do wonders for your PCOS and your chances of getting pregnant.

If you haven\u2019t already, give up on all refined and processed foods and clean up your diet. The ideal diet for PCOS and healthy pregnancy should include more fiber-rich vegetables and fruits, along with lean proteins and healthy fats. Add grass-fed butter, coconut oil, ghee, extra-virgin olive oil, avocados, fatty fish, nuts and seeds to your diet, but cut back on dairy. We also recommend that you add healthy, natural probiotic foods to your diet.<\/p>\n<p>Increasing your intake of calcium-rich foods will further prepare your body for a healthy pregnancy. Don\u2019t worry that your PCOS diet requires you to cut back on dairy; there are plenty of dairy-free sources of calcium to choose from. Eat more of salmon, sardines, kale, bok choy, almonds, figs, tofu, seaweed, oranges, sesame seeds and turnip greens &#8212; these are all rich in calcium too.<\/p>\n<p>We also recommend that you cut back on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/coffee-and-pcos\/\"> caffeine<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-alcohol\/\">alcohol<\/a>\u00a0as both can affect fertility.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Stay_Active\">Stay Active<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_20565\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Stay-Active.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20565\" class=\"wp-image-20565 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Stay-Active.webp\" alt=\"pcos and healthy pregnancy\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20565\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stay Active<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Regular exercise will prepare your body for pregnancy and also improve insulin sensitivity, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10683091\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research<\/a>.

Anovulatory infertility is the inability to conceive\u00a0due to the absence of ovulation. A trend towards higher pregnancy and cumulative pregnancy rates was detected in the group who exercised regularly.<\/p>\n<p>However, scientific evidence also shows that high intensity and frequency exercises may reduce fertility. Instead, experts recommend moderate regular exercise to boost fertility. In fact, they believe it improves pregnancy rate for those undergoing fertility treatment.<\/p>\n<p>Cardio exercise at a\u00a0moderate level for 30-45 minutes, 3 times per week should help with PCOS and healthy pregnancy. A bi-weekly 30-minute strength training session is also highly recommended. You can also try yoga once or twice a week.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/benefits-aerobic-exercise-pcos\/\">The Wonderful Benefits Of Aerobic Exercise For Women With PCOS<\/a><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"Lose_Weight\">Lose Weight<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_20566\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Lose-Weight.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20566\" class=\"wp-image-20566 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Lose-Weight.webp\" alt=\"pcos and healthy pregnancy\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lose Weight<\/p><\/div>\n<p>For individuals who are overweight or obese, achieving and maintaining a modest weight loss may improve fertility. <a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/humrep\/article\/13\/6\/1502\/815807\/Weight-loss-in-obese-infertile-women-results-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studies<\/a> show that weight loss should be considered as the first option for women who are infertile and overweight.
