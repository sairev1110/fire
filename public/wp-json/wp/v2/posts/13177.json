Many of us find them as a perfect on-the-go meal in our busy schedules. You might want to take a second look at that!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Protein_Bars_Are_A_Paradise_for_Sugar_Lovers\">Protein Bars Are A Paradise for Sugar Lovers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A protein bar&#8217;s is a nutritional supplement that provides protein and other nutrients for your body. However, not all protein bars are healthy. Even though we may think of them as easy energy boosters, we fail to realize that these protein bars boast of high <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/hidden-sugars-smoke-out-those-villains-hiding-in-plain-sight\/\">quantities of sugar<\/a>. Moreover, the quality of \u00a0protein in the bar, and the amount and quality of the added ingredients matter. These factors greatly influence whether these bars help us or harm us.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"A_Snack_Or_A_Meal_Replacement\">A Snack Or A Meal Replacement?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Many times people forget that these pocket-sized protein bar&#8217;s can never compensate for a full meal. Because, they cannot replace the nutrients found in whole-food sources. These protein bars could end up denying you the benefits of vitamins, heart-healthy fats, phytochemicals and fiber that are found in abundance in natural food.<\/p>\n<p>One should not judge the protein bars on the basis of their sizes. A small protein bar does not qualify as a quick snack. The calorie count should be taken into account while consuming it. Some of the protein bars may have calories as high as 400. These protein bar&#8217;s claim to be \u2018nutrient-packed\u2019 but if you eat too much, you are bound to gain weight.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatives in regular food such as red meat (lamb, pork, beef), poultry (chicken, duck, turkey), eggs, dairy products (milk, cheese), beans and tofu would work better in giving the required protein intake to your body.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Are_You_Ready_to_Pay_The_Price\">Are You Ready to Pay The Price?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While protein bar&#8217;s are convenient to consume, they are often more expensive than a meal made from natural food sources. Sports nutritionist Nancy Clark estimates that protein bars cost up to three times more than whole food, which contains an equivalent amount of protein. It is thus clear, that if our natural food intake can supply us with the required amount of protein and energy to meet our needs, consumption of protein bars will just add unwanted calories to our diet.<\/p>\n<p>Also, too much protein, if consumed for a long time, can increase your risk of developing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/osteoporosis\/\">osteoporosis<\/a> and end up in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/protect-kidneys-diabetes-damage\/\">kidney problems<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tips_to_Follow_While_Choosing_Protein_Bars\">Tips to Follow While Choosing Protein Bars<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If at all you have to reach out for a protein bar, try following these tips.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ideally stick to limited quantities, the lesser you have the better it is.<\/li>\n<li>Try having them along with some regular food, for example, fruits.<\/li>\n<li>Check the number of calories listed, particularly if you are watching your weight. Go for one that has less than 5g of fat.<\/li>\n<li>Preferably choose a bar that has 3 to 5g of fiber<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A protein bar is a nutritional supplement that provides protein and other nutrients for your body.
