What if we told you that belief is a complete myth? To paraphrase the words of Mark Twain, &#8220;What gets us into trouble is not what we don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s what we know for sure that just ain&#8217;t so.&#8221; Find out why cholesterol is not bad for your health.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cholesterol_Is_Simply_Cholesterol_8211_Not_Good_Or_Bad\">Cholesterol Is Simply Cholesterol &#8211; Not Good Or Bad!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Cholesterol is required by the body and is present in every cell. It helps in the production of cell membranes, hormones, neurological activities, bile acids, and even Vitamin D. In short, cholesterol is very important for your body.<\/p>\n<p>Most people believe that LDL (low-density lipo-protein) is the bad cholesterol while HDL (high-density lipo-protein) is the good cholesterol. However, these two are lipo-proteins, which are just carriers, and not cholesterol themselves. Cholesterol, just like fat, isn\u2019t water soluble. It needs carriers to move it around the body. LDL carries the cholesterol from the liver to the bloodstream (\u201cfresh\u201d cholesterol) to all parts of the body. And HDL transports the cholesterol from the bloodstream to the liver (\u201crecycled\u201d cholesterol). So two reiterate, LDL and HDL are simply form of proteins.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Link_Or_the_Lack_of_It_between_Cholesterol_and_Heart_Disease\">The Link (Or the Lack of It) between Cholesterol and Heart Disease<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21160131\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In a Japanese study<\/a>, it was concluded that a low level of cholesterol in the blood was related to high mortality (not considering those deaths caused due to liver disorders). On the contrary, it was observed that high cholesterol was not a risk factor for mortality.<\/p>\n<p>In a study funded by the Western Vascular Institute, various cohort studies conducted on cholesterol and heart diseases were reviewed. The review concluded that higher levels of LDL did not increase the risk of heart disease. While the publication mentions that more research is needed into this, it does challenge the popular notion that higher LDL causes more heart diseases.<\/p>\n<p>Another research mentions that recent evidence from human studies has documented the lack of effect of dietary cholesterol on coronary heart disease risk. This means the restrictions on dietary cholesterol need to be revisited.<\/p>\n<p>A study in Korea, suggests caution in prescribing statins (lipid inhibitory drugs) for primary prevention of heart diseases in low-risk adults.<\/p>\n<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the USA. However, over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aihcenter.net\/single-post\/2015\/07\/14\/75-of-Those-Who-Have-Heart-Attacks-Have-Normal-Cholesterol-A-Special-Report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">75% of people suffering heart attacks <\/a>have normal cholesterol levels.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cholesterol_Is_Good_For_The_Brain_Too\">Cholesterol Is Good For The Brain Too<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Around 25% of our body\u2019s cholesterol is found in the brain. In fact, cholesterol is one of the raw materials in the production of hormones like testosterone, progesterone, estrogen. It even acts as an antioxidant.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2614555\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research<\/a> conducted on older individuals suggested that memory was better in people with higher LDL cholesterol levels.<\/p>\n<p>A study also showed that higher levels of cholesterol suggested a reduced risk of dementia in late life.<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, there\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest that cholesterol is not bad for the body. We, at Sepalika, believe that lowering your cholesterol levels is harmful for your body. Cholesterol is there to do a job. Lowering cholesterol with drugs does not reduce your risk of a heart attack. In fact, cholesterol-lowering medicines come with their own share of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/side-effects-of-statins\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">side effects<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Cholesterol Is Simply Cholesterol &#8211; Not Good Or Bad!2 The Link (Or the Lack of It) between Cholesterol and Heart Disease3 Cholesterol Is Good For The Brain Too There is an old belief that cholesterol causes heart attacks.
