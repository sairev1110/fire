The painful red cysts can make you feel embarrassed and self-conscious. The acne can make it difficult for you to leave the house without cover-up makeup. And even then it\u2019s not easy to hide! Acne needs to be dealt with both externally and internally. While you can take steps to heal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-acne\/\">PCOS acne<\/a> from within through a healthy diet, exercise and helpful supplements, natural skin-friendly remedies can help calm your irritated, inflamed skin. Here is a look at 10 all-natural treatments for PCOS acne that help heal your skin from the outside.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Raw_Honey\">Raw Honey<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20312\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Raw-Honey.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20312\" class=\"wp-image-20312 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Raw-Honey.webp\" alt=\"natural treatments for pcos acne\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20312\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Raw Honey<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Raw honey is a potent topical remedy for acne, especially if you can get your hands on raw Manuka honey. It has significant antibacterial effects. Also, it is a great all-natural moisturizer to soothe red, inflamed, acne-ridden skin. It removes excess oils, unclogs pores and leaves skin softer and smoother. Find OTC cleansers too harsh for your acne-prone skin? Try mixing a pinch of cinnamon into a tablespoon of raw honey for a DIY acne cleanser that is gentle on sensitive skin.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Willow_Bark_Extract\">Willow Bark Extract<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20314\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Willow-Bark-Extract.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20314\" class=\"wp-image-20314 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Willow-Bark-Extract.webp\" alt=\"natural treatments for pcos acne\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20314\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Willow Bark Extract<\/p><\/div>\n<p>If you want an all-natural alternative to salicylic acid (a common ingredient in acne products,) try willow bark. It has astringent, anti-inflammatory, soothing and conditioning properties. As a natural exfoliator, it helps slough off dead skin cells to open up clogged pores, and also stimulate new cell generation.\u00a0This is why this amazing natural extract is added to many OTC acne cleansers and scar treatments. Make your own scrub to gently exfoliate skin, or look for an OTC cleanser with willow bark as an active ingredient.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Australian_Tea_Tree_Oil\">Australian Tea Tree Oil<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20315\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Australian-Tea-Tree-Oil.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20315\" class=\"wp-image-20315 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Australian-Tea-Tree-Oil.webp\" alt=\"natural treatments for pcos acne\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Australian Tea Tree Oil<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Tea tree oil is an excellent natural treatment for PCOS acne. It has antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Extracted from the leaves of Australian tea tree, tea tree oil\u2019s antibacterial activity works wonders against harmful microbes. And because it is all natural, it doesn&#8217;t damage normal, healthy skin microbes. <a href=\"http:\/\/europepmc.org\/abstract\/med\/2145499\">Studies<\/a> have found that 5% tea-tree oil works just as well as 5% benzoyl peroxide\u00a0for treating acne.

And its anti-inflammatory action prevents new cystic acne from forming underneath the skin. For maximum benefits, get an aloe vera plant and use the fresh gel from its leaves. You can apply the gel to cleansed skin like a moisturizer, or even add it to homemade face masks.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Grapeseed_Oil\">Grapeseed Oil<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20318\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Grapeseed-Oil.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20318\" class=\"wp-image-20318 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Grapeseed-Oil.webp\" alt=\"natural treatments for pcos acne\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20318\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grapeseed Oil<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Grapeseed oil is another topical natural treatment for PCOS acne worth trying. It is rich in linoleic acid, which activates receptors in the sebaceous glands. These glands can control the production of sebum (an oily, waxy matter that lubricates the skin) and make your skin less oily. Its anti-microbial properties fight against acne-causing bacteria. Grapeseed oil also contains anti-inflammatory properties to soothe red, irritated acne-prone skin. It\u2019s also one of the best sources of Vitamin E, which works wonders to heal cystic acne. Apply a thin layer to your face, neck and chest post-cleansing like any other skin lotion.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Green_Tea\">Green Tea<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20319\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Green-Tea.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20319\" class=\"wp-image-20319 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Green-Tea.webp\" alt=\"natural treatments for pcos acne\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20319\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Green Tea<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Green tea has potent anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. These help in treating cystic acne when applied topically. It can soothe irritated skin, reducing sebum production and protect your skin from acne-inducing bacteria. Scientists believe that green tea polyphenols can be an effective treatment for skin disorders caused by androgen (male sex hormones.) \u00a0These disorders include excess body hair and possibly acne. Steep a tablespoon of green tea in a cup of boiling water for 8-10 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool, and use it as a facial toner to heal PCOS acne.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Apple_Cider_Vinegar\">Apple Cider Vinegar<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20320\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Apple-Cider-Vinegar.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20320\" class=\"wp-image-20320 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Apple-Cider-Vinegar.webp\" alt=\"natural treatments for pcos acne\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20320\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple Cider Vinegar<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Apple cider vinegar offers a world of health benefits, but did you know it can also help against cystic acne? Apple cider vinegar (ACV) contains several organic acids &#8211; like lactic, acetic, citric, and succinic acid. Studies have shown that lactic acid applied topically to the skin can lead to significant reduction in acne. ACV has strong antimicrobial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, the acids in ACV help restore skin\u2019s natural acidity which encourages healthy bacteria flora. Use it as a toner to heal PCOS acne and balance pH of your skin.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Marigold\">Marigold<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20321\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Marigold.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20321\" class=\"wp-image-20321 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Marigold.webp\" alt=\"natural treatments for pcos acne\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20321\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marigold<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Marigold also has potent anti-inflammatory properties that help soothe acne-prone skin. Its antimicrobial action further fights bacterial infections and prevents new cysts from forming. It soothes the skin and keeps the irritation from getting worse. Research has found marigold can be used as a safe and effective treatment of acne. Boil 2-3 marigold flowers with a cup of water for 2 minutes. Allow to cool, and use it as a toner for acne-prone skin. This toner also helps with cystic acne scarring.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Licorice_Extract\">Licorice Extract<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20322\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Licorice-Extract.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20322\" class=\"wp-image-20322 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Licorice-Extract.webp\" alt=\"natural treatments for pcos acne\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20322\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Licorice Extract<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Licorice can help restore hormonal balance when ingested, but this amazing extract can also be applied topically to treat PCOS acne. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/licorice-for-pcos\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">Licorice <\/a>root has powerful anti-inflammatory action which makes it an effective topical treatment for dermatitis, acne and cysts. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23731195\">study<\/a> found that when a topical treatment containing Licorice extract was used to treat acne, it resulted in reduced sebum production and acne, while skin hydration was improved. A homemade face mask with powdered licorice root is a must-add to your PCOS acne-fighting arsenal.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"A_Word_On_Makeup\">A Word On Makeup<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Hiding a problem is never a solution.\u00a0We know that. Yet, many women with PCOS <u>need<\/u> to use makeup to cover their embarrassing acne every day. Color correcting concealers and sheer foundation can offer coverage, making you feel more confident in public. Along with natural treatments for PCOS acne to heal your skin from within, make sure you are using makeup with least number of harmful ingredients. Always stick to non-comedogenic, paraben-free, sulfate-free and oil-free beauty products that don\u2019t clog pores and irritate delicate skin. Also, avoid all alcohol-based beauty products as these can agitate acne-prone skin. But most importantly, make sure that you keep your makeup brushes, sponges, and beauty blenders clean and free from acne-causing bacteria! Wash them with a mild soap weekly and allow them to completely dry before next use. Spray rubbing alcohol on powders, blushes and eye-shadows every 10 to 15 days to disinfect your makeup.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
