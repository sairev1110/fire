Let&#8217;s find out why bilberry is an excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/eyesight\/5-foods-help-improve-eyesight\/\">food for healthy eyes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rich_In_Antioxidants\">Rich In Antioxidants<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Bilberry is rich in natural chemicals called anthocyanosides. Anthocyanosides are pigments in plants that are powerful antioxidants. Studies have been conducted to find out the benefits of bilberry for eye&#8217;s. It was found that anthocyanosides in bilberry have positive effects on vision, in low lighting conditions. These antioxidants prevent cells from getting damaged and also repair damaged cells.<\/p>\n<p>During World War 2, it was reported that British fighter pilots used bilberry for eyes. They took it in the form of jams or tea to improve their night-time vision. The extracts of bilberry also protect eyes from against macular degeneration and cataracts.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Prevent_Cell_Damage_In_The_Retina\">Prevent Cell Damage In The Retina<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Another research was conducted to study the effects of cell damage in the retina after exposure to blue light-emitting diodes (blue LEDs.). It was found that using bilberry for eyes protected the retinal cells\u00a0from damage due to exposure to light. If these cells are damaged, it becomes difficult to\u00a0distinguish between different colors and shapes.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Useful_For_Several_Eye_Problems\">Useful For Several Eye Problems<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Using bilberry for eyes helps in treating a variety of vision-related problems, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the treatment of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.umm.edu\/health\/medical\/altmed\/condition\/glaucoma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">glaucoma<\/a>, standard extracts of bilberry are used for its antioxidant properties and vision support. The extracts also help in improving blood flow in the vessels, especially to the blood vessels in the eyes.<\/li>\n<li>Using bilberry for eyes helps in preventing and treating myopia or near-sightedness.<\/li>\n<li>As seen above, bilberry\u2019s antioxidant properties help in improving blood flow to the vessels in the eyes. This reduces eye strain and improves nerve function near the eyes.<\/li>\n<li>It also helps in preventing diabetic radiotherapy. In this condition,\u00a0new blood vessels may grow in the retina. A gel-like fluid could fill the back of the eyes and could also leak into them, causing cloudy vision.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Rich In Antioxidants2 Prevent Cell Damage In The Retina3 Useful For Several Eye Problems Bilberry belongs to the blueberry family.
