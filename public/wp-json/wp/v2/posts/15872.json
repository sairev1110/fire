It\u2019s all a bit disturbing, we agree. But, before you start googling your symptoms, worried that you might be dealing with some life-threatening illness, here\u2019s a thought for you. If you\u2019re over 35 years of age, chances are that you\u2019re just experiencing the symptoms of Perimenopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Perimenopause_Beginning_Your_Transition_to_Menopause\"><strong>Perimenopause: Beginning Your Transition to Menopause<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Perimenopause.webp\" alt=\"Common symptoms perimenopause\" class=\"wp-image-20897\"\/><figcaption>Perimenopause<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, what on earth is perimenopause? Most of us have heard of menopause \u2013 the end of menstruation and fertility that most women experience in their late 40s to 50s. But the transition to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/menopause\/menopause-symptoms-supplements\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"menopause (opens in a new tab)\">menopause<\/a> can begin several years earlier, and this phase is known as perimenopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perimenopause can begin 8 to 10 years\nbefore you officially hit menopause. Most women begin experiencing\nperimenopause symptoms when they\u2019re in their late 30s to early 40s. With age,\nthe ovaries reduce production of estrogen and progesterone, causing\nperimenopause. Your estrogen levels may fluctuate sporadically, going up or\ndown, which can hinder with your normal 28-day menstrual cycle. This is why\nyour periods have become irregular and hard to predict. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During perimenopause, the ovaries are still\nproducing estrogen (albeit, in lower levels) so you still have periods \u2013 they\njust don\u2019t follow their usual pattern. You can also get pregnant during\nperimenopause. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This pattern continues until the ovaries\nstart producing very little estrogen. The first stage is that the low estrogen\nis unable to stimulate the release of an egg from your ovaries, which is meant\nto happen every period cycle. Release of an egg is what triggers production of\nprogesterone, so this first stops. When this low estrogen phase continues for a\nperiod of time, eventually, your periods end altogether. Menopause officially\nkicks in when you haven\u2019t had a period in the last 12 months. But if you still\nexperience occasional spotting or have a period every few months, you are still\nin perimenopause phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bear in mind, sometimes perimenopause can happen\nsooner for some women, especially if:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You are genetically inclined for early menopause (ask your mother and\/or your aunts about when their menopause happened)<\/li><li>You are a smoker<\/li><li>You have undergone chemotherapy<\/li><li> You have had surgeries to remove ovaries or uterus  <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"The_Common_Symptoms_of_Perimenopause\"><strong>The Common Symptoms of Perimenopause<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/The-Common-Symptoms-of-Perimenopause.webp\" alt=\"Common symptoms perimenopause\" class=\"wp-image-20899\"\/><figcaption>The Common Symptoms of Perimenopause<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Perimenopause is a natural biological process that is a part of aging. It\u2019s not an illness, and it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. However, some women may experience disturbing symptoms of perimenopause that can be treated with natural therapies, a healthy diet, regular exercise and alternative treatments.<br>So, what are these symptoms<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Difficulty_Predicting_Periods\"><strong>Difficulty Predicting Periods<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you age, and your reproductive ability begins to diminish, estrogen levels start to fluctuate, since your ovaries are unable to produce estrogen its previous predictable pattern. Since estrogen is the hormone that builds the inner lining of your uterus each month, irregular estrogen production results in the uterine lining not being built properly and it may be shed in small amounts in an unpredictable pattern. You may notice light spotting some months, occurring without any set pattern. <br><br>On the other hand, the lengthened time gap between two periods may cause uterine lining or endometrium to become quite thick between proper periods. This means that when you do have your period \u2013 the flow is very heavy. And can come with blood clots and severe cramps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Worsened_PMS\"><strong>Worsened PMS<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As your periods become irregular, you may notice that your PMS symptoms worsen. You may have headaches during your period and suffer from severe cramping, soreness and mood changes. This is happening because the hormones estrogen and progesterone play multiple roles in your body beyond reproduction. One of their important roles is to help you manage stress better. When their production reduces, your PMS symptoms get far worse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Decreased_Fertility\"><strong>Decreased Fertility<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we age, estrogen levels start to wane and the ovaries stop producing eggs regularly. Additionally, age can also result in diminished quality of eggs. If you\u2019re in your late 30s and trying to get pregnant, perimenopause can make it harder to conceive. However, do not assume that decreased fertility means you cannot get pregnant and stop using contraception if you don\u2019t want to get pregnant. As long as you\u2019re in perimenopause, you can still get pregnant. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Breast_Tenderness\"><strong>Breast Tenderness<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Changing estrogen levels can make your breasts feel sore, heavy ad tender. As estrogen production becomes erratic during perimenopause, your breasts may feel swollen or lumpy due to fluid retention. Considering that lengthened time interval between ovulation and periods during perimenopause, breast tenderness can feel worse than before. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Hot_Flashes\"><strong>Hot Flashes<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hot flashes are not just for menopausal\nwomen. In fact, they can start several years earlier, during perimenopause, and\noften come as a surprise. A hot flash is an intense sensation of heat in the\nface, neck and chest that causes sweating or chills. Caused due to estrogen\ndeficiency, hot flashes can make it harder to concentrate on work or chores,\nparticularly in warmer weather.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Night_Sweats\"><strong>Night Sweats<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When hot flashes occur at night, they are\ntermed as night sweats. During perimenopause, fluctuating estrogen levels can\nawaken you from sleep with profuse sweating. This can lead to sleep\ndisturbances, insomnia and fatigue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Nausea\"><strong>Nausea<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perimenopause comes with sporadically\nfluctuating levels of estrogen due to disruption in hormonal balance. As a\nresult, day to day production of estrogen becomes unpredictable. When estrogen\nlevels go up, you may experience nausea. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Bloating\"><strong>Bloating<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes during perimenopause the overall\nproduction of estrogen in the ovaries increases, even though day-to-day\nproduction becomes unpredictable. Another symptom of higher-than-usual estrogen\nlevels is bloating. Excess estrogen in the body leads to fluid retention, and\nyou may notice swelling, tightness and fullness in the abdominal area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Gastrointestinal_Distress\"><strong>Gastrointestinal Distress<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluctuating levels of estrogen in your body\nduring perimenopause can also increase gastrointestinal distress. You may\nsuddenly notice constipation or slow digestion, accompanied by bloating. Some\nwomen also complain of increased flatulence, gas pain, indigestion and nausea\nafter eating, all reflecting digestive changes caused by hormonal imbalance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Weight_Gain\"><strong>Weight Gain<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of your recent weight gain may be\ncaused by fluid retention. However, fluctuating estrogen levels also interferes\nwith appetite regulation, causing you to eat more than usual. Some women also\nreport more food cravings when their hormones are out of sync. Reduced estrogen\nlevels may also slow down metabolism. All these factors contribute towards\nweight gain during perimenopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Difficulty_Concentrating\"><strong>Difficulty Concentrating<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Oscillating estrogen levels can make it\nharder for you to focus and concentrate. It\u2019s not uncommon for women to\nexperience foggy thinking and memory lapses during perimenopause. This can add\nto your stress levels and anxiety when lack of concentration interferes with\nwork and chores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Changes_in_Skin\"><strong>Changes in Skin<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some women report severe dryness and skin\nirritation during perimenopause. For others, the acne they thought they were\ndone with post adolescence returns with a vengeance. Changing hormone levels\ncan bring with them undesirable skin changes which also include \u2013 dark circles\nunder eyes, puffy eyes, increase in facial hair or unusual hair growth around\nnipples and breasts. It\u2019s not just skin though, you may also notice that your\nnails become brittle and hair fall increases as hormones fluctuate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Sleep_Disturbances\"><strong>Sleep Disturbances<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hormonal oscillations make it harder for you to get a good night\u2019s sleep. Night sweats are a common factor. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2015\/06\/150616131534.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Studies<\/a> have found that perimenopausal women experience more sleep disturbances just prior to menstruation, during the luteal phase, than they did during the phase after menstruation, the follicular phase, as the hormone progesterone influences sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Changes_in_Mood\"><strong>Changes in Mood<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fluctuating hormone levels during perimenopause can lead to\nmood swings, irritability, feeling low, anxiety and depression. These are more\ncommonly seen in women who experience night sweats, due to lack of sleep,\nfatigue and exhaustion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Elevated_LDL\"><strong>Elevated LDL<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As estrogen levels fall, it can cause LDL\nor bad cholesterol levels to rise. These lipid changes increase risk of\ncardiovascular disease and should be fixed with healthy lifestyle changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Low_Libido\"><strong>Low Libido<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lowered levels of estrogen can cause lowered sex drive. <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/BF01542000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Studies<\/a> have found that a close association exists between increasing irregularity of menstrual cycles, hot flashes, declining estrogen levels, and declining frequency of intercourse during the perimenopause.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Vaginal_Dryness\"><strong>Vaginal Dryness<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Estrogen is crucial for\nmaintaining vaginal health. Lowered estrogen levels can lead to vaginal\ndryness. Loss of hydration from vaginal tissue and thinning of vaginal walls\nfurther contribute to reduced sex drive, as intercourse becomes more painful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Bladder_Problems\"><strong>Bladder Problems<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Low systemic levels of estrogen\ncan lead to a variety of bladder problems. You may notice that you become more\nsusceptible to urinary tract infections (UTIs) during perimenopause. Estrogen\ndecline can also cause urinary urgency, where you feel the need to urinate\nfrequently. In some cases, urinary incontinence may also occur where small\namount of urine may leak out during coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting a\nheavy object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Bone_Density_Loss\"><strong>Bone Density Loss<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Estrogen is intrinsically linked with maintain bone density. As estrogen levels diminish or fluctuate erratically, bones can become depleted of calcium. This leads to reduced bone density which can cause osteoporosis with time. It\u2019s very important for perimenopausal women to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/menopause\/weight-training-menopause\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">maintain bone density<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Allergy_Attacks\"><strong>Allergy Attacks<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As estrogen levels wane,\nyour immune system weakens too. This makes you more susceptible to seasonal\nallergies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these are the common symptoms of perimenopause, you can now see that it is just the precursor to menopause. The list of <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">menopause symptoms[SA1]<\/a>&nbsp; is slightly longer, so if your perimenopause symptom is not listed here, do check that out too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these distressing symptoms of perimenopause are\ninterfering with your quality of life, we highly recommend natural remedies and\nalternative therapies to minimize your symptoms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Sepalikas_Natural_Menopause_Treatment_Program\"><strong>Sepalika\u2019s Natural Menopause Treatment Program<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sepalika Menopause Programme is scientifically designed\nto help women deal with all the other symptoms of peri-menopause and menopause.\nEach person\u2019s treatment is tailor-made as per their symptoms, medical history\nand lab test results.
