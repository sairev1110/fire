Since we are used to this scenario in the movies or on TV, we think of it as the only sign of serious heart disease. However, there are many more signs of heart attack, which most people are unaware of. Also, more importantly, when compared to men, women face different symptoms of a serious heart condition.<\/p>\n<p>So why do women not think of \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/how-long-can-you-live-with-chf\/\">heart disease<\/a>\u201d when these symptoms happen? First, most of us simply don\u2019t know. Because no one told us these symptoms could be precursors to a heart attack.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Lesser-Known_Signs_and_Symptoms_of_Heart_Attack_in_Women\">\u00a0Lesser-Known Signs and Symptoms of Heart Attack in Women<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In a study involving 515 women aged 29 to 97 years (average of 66), researchers interviewed them after they were discharged from hospital post a heart attack. \u00a0These women were asked to identify the signs and symptoms they felt\u00a0<em>in the month<\/em>\u00a0<em>before<\/em> the heart attack. Here\u2019s what they picked from a list of 70 signs and symptoms.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Unusual_fatigue_70\">Unusual fatigue (70%)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>More than 70% of women in the survey experienced unusual fatigue that felt like \u201chaving a flu\u201d. Fatigue is common with women as they age. But if you are fatigued even if you aren\u2019t exerting yourself, you should pay attention to these signs. How is fatigue connected to a heart attack? When your heart isn\u2019t pumping enough blood, your cells don\u2019t get enough oxygen to burn fuel and generate energy.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sleep_Disturbance_48\">Sleep Disturbance (48%)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A weak heart decreases levels of circulating oxygen in the body, which may lead to insomnia or unexplained awakenings in the night. If sleep disturbances have no apparent reason, like work-related stress or acid reflux, then they could be related to heart troubles.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">Related: <a href=\" https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/heartburn-at-night-16-tips-avoid\/2\/\">16 Tips To Avoid Heartburn At Night<\/a><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"Shortness_of_Breath_42\">Shortness of Breath (42%)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Shortness of breath is common as women age. Lack of physical exercise and weight gain may sometimes result in shortness of breath due to exertion. But sudden sweating and shortness of breath without any exertion can be a sign of heart trouble. If you have heart trouble, your breathlessness will worsen over time with exertion. You could also experience breathlessness that worsens when you are lying down, but improves as soon as you sit or stand.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/shortness-of-breath-acid-reflux\/\/\">Shortness of breath and acid reflux<\/a><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"Indigestion_39\">Indigestion (39%)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A dull or sharp pain in the stomach may also be a sign of an impending heart attack. Angina pain due to arterial blockage isn\u2019t just experienced in the chest. Sometimes, pain signals travel to the abdomen and manifests as stomachache. Poor blood circulation can also lead to symptoms of indigestion like nausea and vomiting.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Anxiety_35\">Anxiety (35%)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Anxiety attacks, especially a feeling of dread or doom at night, can be clues to an unknown heart problem. If feelings of anxiety aren\u2019t related to any recent events or any other emotional triggers, they may signal a coronary heart disease. Such bouts of anxiety are also due to improper distribution of oxygen in the body, especially to the brain.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In fact, less than a third of women experienced the symptom we all associate with a heart attack \u2013 chest pain \u2013 in the month before they have a heart attack.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Second, if you go over the list again, you will realize that a lot of these appear as routine and harmless symptoms. Most women tend to take these symptoms in their stride and carry on with life. While this may be a common response, if these symptoms persist, we need to take them seriously and ensure they are not signs of a more serious condition.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, women with certain risk factors should take the above symptoms more seriously than others.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Common_Risk_Factors_Of_A_Heart_Attack_In_Women_You_Need_To_Know\">Common Risk Factors Of A Heart Attack In Women You Need To Know<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18600\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Article-Image-2.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18600\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18600\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Article-Image-2.webp\" alt=\"Heart Attack imminent? 5 little known signs Women ignore. \" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Heart Attack imminent? 5 little known signs Women ignore.<\/p><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Diabetes<\/em>: Women with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/diabetes-and-heart-disease\/\">diabetes <\/a>have twice the risk of heart disease than women without it.<\/li>\n<li><em>Smoking<\/em>: Women smokers are likely to have a heart attack 19 years sooner than non-smokers.<\/li>\n<li><em>Obesity<strong>:\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>It is a well-known fact that obesity directly increases risk of cardiac disease and events.
