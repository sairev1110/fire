In just 25 years, the global incidence of diabetes has doubled, according to the World Health Organization.\u00a0More than 15 million women are living with type 2 diabetes in the United States alone and another 40 million are<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/symptoms-prediabetes-women\/\"> prediabetic<\/a>, according to CDC (Center for Disease Control) statistics of 2017.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Symptoms_of_Diabetes_in_Women\">Symptoms of Diabetes in Women<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While many signs and symptoms of diabetes are common in men and women, women experience certain unique symptoms. These are:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vaginal_and_Oral_Infections\">Vaginal and Oral Infections<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Overgrowth of a yeast called <em>Candida albicans<\/em> causes vaginal and oral yeast <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/diabetes-and-infections\/\">infections<\/a>, called \u201cthrush.\u201d High levels of glucose in the blood are favorable for the growth of this yeast. Vaginal infections are accompanied by symptoms like soreness, itching, vaginal discharge and pain during sex. When the infection is oral, a cottage cheese-like coating is seen on the tongue and the inside of the mouth.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Urinary_Tract_Infections\">Urinary Tract Infections<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The risk of UTIs is higher in women with diabetes. UTIs occur when bacteria gain access to the urinary tract, where they colonize and cause infection. Signs and symptoms include painful urination, burning sensation while urination, fever and cloudy (sometimes bloody) urine. High blood glucose levels, poor circulation and the inability of immune cells to effectively fight bacteria are all causes of UTIs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"col-md-12 arti-subsc\">\n<div class=\"subscriberow\">[mc4wp_form id=&#8221;12950&#8243;]<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"Poor_Sexual_Health\">Poor Sexual Health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>High levels of blood sugar often cause a condition called<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/connection-diabetes-neuropathy\/\"> diabetic neuropathy<\/a>. This is a condition in which nerves lose their ability to effectively transmit signals between the organs and brain. This can lead to partial or complete loss of sensation in parts of the body including hands, legs and feet. Vagina is an organ with a rich network of nerves. It is, thus, one of the most sensitive organs of the female body. Neuropathy may significantly affect sensation in the vagina, leading to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/managing-diabetes-sexual-problems-women\/\">lower sexual drive<\/a> in women.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Polycystic_Ovarian_Syndrome_PCOS\">Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>PCOS is a metabolic syndrome caused due to hormonal imbalance in the female body. It affects fertility in women and causes irregular periods. Other symptoms include facial hair, loss of hair, acne, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-weight-gain-master-guide\/\">weight gain<\/a>, skin darkening (especially around the neck, elbows and armpit) and depression. Females with PCOS are at a great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-diabetes-type-2\/\">risk of getting diabetes<\/a>. PCOS is thus an important warning sign of an impending diabetic condition.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/pcos-connection-diabetes\/\">PCOS And Its Connection To Diabetes<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Symptoms_of_Diabetes_in_Both_Women_And_Men\">Symptoms of Diabetes in Both Women And Men<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Excessive hunger or thirst (dry mouth)<\/li>\n<li>Fatigue<\/li>\n<li>Frequent urination<\/li>\n<li>Cuts and wounds that heal slowly<\/li>\n<li>Recurrent chest \/ urinary infections<\/li>\n<li>Unexplained weight loss<\/li>\n<li>Blurred vision<\/li>\n<li>Headaches<\/li>\n<li>Reduced sensation in hands and feet<\/li>\n<li>Recurring skin infections<\/li>\n<li>Breath with sweet or fruity odor.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/prediabetes-risk-test-tool\/\">Take the Prediabetes Risk Test<\/a><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"Risk_Factors_for_Diabetes_in_Women\">Risk Factors for Diabetes in Women<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The risk factors for diabetes in women include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Being 45 years or older<\/li>\n<li>Being obese or overweight<\/li>\n<li>Having PCOS<\/li>\n<li>Having developed<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/what-is-gestational-diabetes\/\"> gestational diabetes<\/a> when you were pregnant<\/li>\n<li>Having a family history of diabetes<\/li>\n<li>Having high blood pressure<\/li>\n<li>Having high blood cholesterol<\/li>\n<li>Having a history of heart disease or stroke<\/li>\n<li>Leading a sedentary lifestyle or are active less frequently<\/li>\n<li>Belonging to a certain race (African-American, Native Alaskan, Native American, Asian-American or Pacific Islander)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/can-diabetes-be-prevented\/\">You Can Prevent Diabetes With A Healthy Lifestyle<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Preventing_Early_Signs_Of_Diabetes_In_Women\">Preventing Early Signs Of Diabetes In Women<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18798\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Preventing-early-signs-of-diabetes.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18798\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18798\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Preventing-early-signs-of-diabetes.webp\" alt=\"early signs of diabetes in women\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">early signs of diabetes in women<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"Make_Changes_to_Your_Diet_And_Lifestyle\">Make Changes to Your Diet And Lifestyle<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/diabetes-diet-plan\/\">Diet <\/a>plays an important role in fighting diabetes.
