Every year, millions of people across the globe set New Year resolutions with the hope of bringing a positive change in their life. For those looking to improve their health, the start of a new year is the perfect time to give up some of our unhealthy habits and adopt a healthier lifestyle. Sepalika presents a list of new year health tips that can improve the quality of your life in the next year and beyond.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Get_Sufficient_Sleep\">Get Sufficient Sleep<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20741\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Get-Sufficient-Sleep.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20741\" class=\"wp-image-20741 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Get-Sufficient-Sleep.webp\" alt=\"new year health tips\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20741\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Get Sufficient Sleep<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This is the most obvious, yet often ignored, health tip. Most of us need nearly eight hours of sleep every night, yet so many of us neglect this basic need of our body.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK19961\/\">Research<\/a> has shown that long-term sleep loss can lead to health disorders like diabetes, obesity, hypertension, depression, and heart attack. Insufficient sleep also weakens your immunity, which makes your body vulnerable to illnesses.\u00a0So if you find yourself catching the flu or a cold easily this season, your poor sleeping habits could be to blame.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from health risks, insufficient sleep also impacts your productivity.\u00a0Poor sleeping habits, stress, work pressure, and an uncomfortable sleeping environment are some of the reasons behind the lack of sleep. So, this new year, fix your sleep routine and aim to get enough shut-eye for a healthy life.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Drink_Enough_Water\">Drink Enough Water<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20743\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Drink-Enough-Water.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20743\" class=\"wp-image-20743 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Drink-Enough-Water.webp\" alt=\"new year health tips\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20743\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Drink Enough Water<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This is another simple, yet oft-ignored, health tip. Dehydration can lead to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/dangers-dehydration-dont-see-coming\/\">various illnesses<\/a> such as diabetes, damage to kidneys, chronic pain, and can even lead to mood disruptions. Whether you are working indoors or are out there in the field, aim to drink 2 to 3 liters of water every day. There are several mobile apps that remind you to drink water and help you keep a track of your water intake. Daily Water tracker reminder and Aqualert are two among the many such apps.\u00a0If you find plain water too boring, you can also meet your hydration needs through healthy alternatives like coconut water, home-made vegetable juice, and water-rich foods like watermelon and oranges.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Try_Yoga\">Try Yoga<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20744\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Try-Yoga.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20744\" class=\"wp-image-20744 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Try-Yoga.webp\" alt=\"new year health tips\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20744\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Try Yoga<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Yoga has been giving both physical and mental health benefits to humans for thousands of years. If you are new to yoga, we recommend to learn various poses and techniques from a trained teacher. Start out with simple poses like the cat pose (Marjiarasana), the child pose (Shishuasana), and Chair pose (Utkatasna) before you take up advanced poses. There are also specific asanas for various health conditions. For example,\u00a0Bhadrasana (Butterfly pose) &amp;\u00a0Bhujangasana (Cobra pose) are two good asanas for PCOS. Bhadrasana\u00a0promotes relaxation and relieves period pain, while Bhujangasana stimulates ovarian function.\u00a0Once you\u2019ve learnt the yoga poses suited for your health goals, you can practice them from anywhere.\u00a0Simply set aside 20-30 minutes every day and reap the immense benefits of this ancient science.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Take_Control_Of_Your_Diet\">Take Control Of Your Diet<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20745\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Take-Control-Of-Your-Diet.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20745\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20745\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Take-Control-Of-Your-Diet.webp\" alt=\"new year health tips\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20745\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Take Control Of Your Diet<\/p><\/div>\n<p>We can\u2019t stress the importance of the right diet in improving your overall health. This new year, resolve to eat as much as healthy food as you can. To start off, increase the intake of your good fats through healthy sources like ghee and coconut oil, and ditch refined vegetable oils. Make sure you get 11 tablespoons of good fats everyday (that\u2019s 60% of your overall calorie intake.) This will not only give nutrition benefits, but will also keep you full, thus reducing your intake of carbohydrates and sugar. Reduce your intake of processed sugar and replace it with healthier alternatives like coconut sugar or organic jaggery. Also, minimize your intake of sugar-rich foods like colas, cookies, ketchup and ice cream.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Get_Close_To_Nature\">Get Close To Nature<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20746\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Get-Close-To-Nature.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20746\" class=\"wp-image-20746 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Get-Close-To-Nature.webp\" alt=\"new year health tips\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20746\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Get Close To Nature<\/p><\/div>\n<p>We all know that a simple walk in greenery can reduce our stress and increase our energy. Getting close to nature is much more than that. It also means opting for more organic products. For example, whether you are looking for sunscreens, skin care or deodorants, you will find natural organic products for all your major needs. There\u2019s also a variety of natural herbs, which can serve as remedies for various health challenges like pain, indigestion, constipation, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/14-amazing-herbs-that-lower-blood-sugar\/\">high blood sugar<\/a>. For example,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/gymnema-sylvestre-diabetes\/\">Gymnema Sylvestre<\/a> is an excellent herb for diabetes.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Get_Yourself_Tested_For_Vitamin_D_Deficiency\">Get Yourself Tested For Vitamin D Deficiency<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20747\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Get-Yourself-Tested-For-Vitamin-D-Deficiency.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20747\" class=\"wp-image-20747 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Get-Yourself-Tested-For-Vitamin-D-Deficiency.webp\" alt=\"new year health tips\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20747\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Get Yourself Tested For Vitamin D Deficiency<\/p><\/div>\n<p>According to studies, nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3942730\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">70 to 100%<\/a> of the general population in the Indian subcontinent are affected by Vitamin D deficiency. Even in the US, over 40% of the population is deficient in Vitamin D. Low levels of Vitamin D, also known as the sunshine vitamin, can lead to poor bone health and weakness in the muscles. The blood test for testing Vitamin D is known as 25(OH)D, which is a generally acceptable marker of optimum Vitamin D levels in your body.<\/p>\n<p>Transform your life this new year by incorporating these lifestyle changes in your daily life.
