This energy is then used for all the life processes that happen inside our bodies. Apart from getting glucose from the digestion of food, our bodies have developed an elaborate system of re-absorbing excess glucose that is being removed by the kidneys. SGLT2 is a protein whose job is to facilitate glucose reabsorption in the kidney. It is highly efficient and is responsible for 90% of glucose reabsorption.<\/p>\n<p>Now, since diabetics already have an excess of glucose in their bodies, it does not really make sense to re-absorb excess glucose that the kidneys have worked so hard to remove. And thus to negate the activity of SGLT2, a new class of drugs, called SGLT2 inhibitors, is used to manage blood sugar levels in diabetics.<\/p>\n<p>SGLT2 inhibitors (Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter) are chemicals that prevent re-absorption of glucose by the kidneys, so that it spills out into the urine. This prevents sugar build-up in the bloodstream and brings down blood glucose and insulin levels.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"SGLT2_inhibitors_Mechanism_of_Action\">SGLT2 inhibitors Mechanism of Action<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>SGLT2 inhibitors<\/strong> are a new class of drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They lower blood sugar concentrations by increasing renal excretion of glucose. These compounds<a href=\"http:\/\/pace-cme.org\/2015\/07\/24\/the-mechanism-of-SGLT2-inhibition-in-glucose-control\/\"> reduce glucose reabsorption <\/a>in the kidney and lower blood glucose independent of changes in insulin concentrations.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Should_This_Medicine_be_Used\">How Should This Medicine be Used?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>SGLT2 inhibitors (Empagliflozin) are available as a tablet to be taken orally. It is usually taken once a day in the morning with or without food. Consume SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) at around the same time every day<a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/druginfo\/meds\/a614043.html\">. Follow the directions <\/a>written in your prescription label carefully, and ask your healthcare practitioner or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your healthcare practitioner.<br \/>\nYour healthcare practitioner may start you on a low dose of the medication and depending on how you respond to it, may increase your dose gradually.<\/p>\n<p>This medication simply helps you in controlling your blood sugar levels; it cannot actually treat your diabetes. Do not stop taking your medication just because you are feeling well and never stop taking any medication without consulting your healthcare practitioner.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Most_Prescribed_Names_In_This_Category_of_Drugs_Include\">Most Prescribed Names In This Category of Drugs Include<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Canagliflozin (Invokana), Dapagliflozin (Forxiga), Empagliflozin (Jardiance)<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Side_Effects_That_Could_Happen_as_Soon_as_You_Start_Taking_the_Medication\">Side Effects That Could Happen as Soon as You Start Taking the Medication<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Following are some<a href=\"https:\/\/www.drugwatch.com\/SGLT2-inhibitors\/\"> common SGLT2 inhibitors side effects<\/a>:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Urinary_Tract_Issues\">Urinary Tract Issues<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18717\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Urinary-Tract-Issue-2.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18717\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18717\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Urinary-Tract-Issue-2.webp\" alt=\"Side-effects of SGLT 2\" width=\"779\" height=\"279\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18717\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Side-effects of SGLT 2<\/p><\/div>\n<p>These drugs speed up the excretion of sugar by way of urine. Since bacteria and yeast love sugar, this makes people taking this drug highly susceptible to urinary tract infections. These drugs may also make you urinate more frequently.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Low_Blood_Sugar_or_Hypoglycemia\">Low Blood Sugar or Hypoglycemia<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>These drugs act by increasing the excretion of glucose through urine. This mechanism of action may cause excess excretion of glucose from the body, leading to dangerously low blood sugar levels. Excess sweating, palpitations, dizziness, extreme hunger, palor and tiredness are symptoms that can occur due to hypoglycemia. Long-term effects of SGLT2 inhibitors have not been studied yet, however hypoglycemia is one of the well-documented SGLT2 inhibitors side effects.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Other_Symptoms\">Other Symptoms<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Individual drugs have been found to have a higher incidence of bladder cancer (dapagliflozin) and increase in HDL and LDL cholesterol (canagliflozin). This has been observed in clinical trials. In rare cases, the drug has also been known to cause diabetic ketoacidosis.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Can_You_Do\">What Can You Do?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>These adverse effects can often be handled by your doctor by switching you over to some other class of diabetic medications in case you are prone to urinary infections or have any kind of compromised kidney function. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/supplements-for-type-2-diabetes\/\">Dietary supplements can help support blood sugar control<\/a>, so they can help you reduce the burden of medications and their side effects.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Should_You_Be_Using_SGLT2_inhibitors_for_a_Long_Term\">Should You Be Using SGLT2 inhibitors for a Long Term?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While SGLT2 inhibitors have not been studied for the nutrients that they deplete with long-term use, clinical trials of dapagliflozin showed some incidence of liver damage and breast and bladder cancers amongst users. Trials with canagliflozin showed increases in both LDL (bad) and HDL (good) cholesterol.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Special_Precautions_Should_I_Follow\">What Special Precautions Should I Follow?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You need to inform your healthcare practitioner if you are allergic to the active compound of the medicine or any substances in it. You also need to tell your healthcare practitioner about any other prescription and non-prescription drugs you are taking or any supplements or herbal products you might be taking.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a kidney problem, be sure to tell your healthcare practitioner; it is likely that he\/she may not put you on this medicine. Also talk to your healthcare practitioner if you are pregnant or plan to get pregnant. Do not breastfeed while on this drug.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Should_I_Do_if_I_Forget_a_Dose\">What Should I Do if I Forget a Dose?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Take it as soon as you remember. If more than 12 hours have passed since your missed dose, then skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regularly prescribed time. Do not double your dose to compensate the missed one.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Should_I_Know_About_Storage_and_Disposal_of_this_Medication\">What Should I Know About Storage and Disposal of this Medication?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Store SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin) at room temperature 68-77\u00b0F (20-25\u00b0C).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dietary Considerations, While Taking Medicine:<\/strong> Follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your healthcare practitioner or dietitian. It is important to eat a healthy diet,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/10-tips-preventing-diabetes-type-2\/\"> regulate your lifestyle<\/a> and follow a regular exercise regimen. Drink enough fluids throughout the day while you are on this medication.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Drug_Interactions\">Drug Interactions<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Insulin_or_Insulin_Secretagogues\">Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Taking SGLT2 inhibitors along with insulin or drugs called insulin secretagogues <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.boehringer-ingelheim.com\/Prescribing%20Information\/PIs\/Jardiance\/jardiance.pdf\">increases the risk of hypoglycemia<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Positive_Urine_Glucose_Test\">Positive Urine Glucose Test<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_are_the_ingredients_in_Jardiance_empagliflozin\">What are the ingredients in Jardiance (empagliflozin)?<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The active substance is empagliflozin. Each tablet contains 10 mg or 25 mg empagliflozin.<\/li>\n<li>The other ingredients are:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Tablet core:<\/strong> lactose monohydrate, cellulose microcrystalline, hydroxy propylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate<\/p>\n<p><strong>Film coating:<\/strong> hypromellose, titanium dioxide, talc, macrogol, iron oxide yellow<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Parting_Thoughts\">Parting Thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Being diagnosed with diabetes is not the end of the world.
