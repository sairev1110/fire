However, the herb is highly valued in Ayurveda for its anit-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which can help in the management of inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. These benefits are linked to bioactive compounds in the herb called curcuminoids, the main one being curcumin. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22407780\" target=\"_blank\">Some studies suggest<\/a> that curcumin from turmeric can be just as effective as anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritic pain relief. <br><br>Although turmeric can be added directly to your diet, curcumin absorption is poor, but this can be remedied by consuming it with black pepper. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9619120\" target=\"_blank\">Research shows<\/a> that piperine in black pepper enhances absorption by as much as 2,000%! Alternatively, you could use supplements to ensure you get a dosage of 1,000 mg of curcumin daily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Ashwagandha\"><strong>Ashwagandha<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Ashwagandha.webp\" alt=\"Ayurvedic secrets reduce rheumatoid arthritis symptoms\" class=\"wp-image-21160\"\/><figcaption>Ashwagandha<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ashwagandha is regarded as a rasayana or rejuvenating herb in Ayurveda and may play an important role in the management of rheumatoid arthritis. <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12895672\" target=\"_blank\">Based on research<\/a>, the herb is classified as an adaptogen, which means that it can better manage physiological responses to stress, lower cortisol levels, and other inflammatory triggers. The herb can help relive rheumatoid arthritis pain through both its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, with a study published in the <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4405924\/\" target=\"_blank\">Indian Journal of Medical Research<\/a> pointing to its efficacy.<br><br>Researchers observed <a aria-label=\"improvements in rheumatoid arthritis (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/benefits-of-ashwagandha\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">improvements in rheumatoid arthritis<\/a> with a daily supplementation of 5g of ashwagandha powder twice a day. You can consume the herb as a supplement or in powder foram along with warm water or milk. There is inadequate research on the safety of higher doses, so check with your physician before increasing intake of ashwagandha.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Avoid_Nightshades\"><strong>Avoid Nightshades<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Avoid-Nightshades.webp\" alt=\"Ayurvedic secrets reduce rheumatoid arthritis symptoms\" class=\"wp-image-21159\"\/><figcaption>Avoid Nightshades<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some patients may also find benefits from eliminating or restricting the intake of nightshade foods such as eggplants, potatoes, bell peppers, and tomatoes, among others. Although generally regarded as healthy and nutritionally rich, these foods can exacerbate inflammatory immune responses in some individuals. This may be linked to the presence of alkaloids like glycoalkaloid solanine, which can have a pro-inflammatory effect in some patients.  <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Yoga_Meditation\"><strong>Yoga &amp; Meditation<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Yoga-Meditation.webp\" alt=\"Ayurvedic secrets reduce rheumatoid arthritis symptoms\" class=\"wp-image-21158\"\/><figcaption>Yoga &#038; Meditation<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of taking up yoga or any exercise may be daunting when you suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, but staying inactive can severely exacerbate the symptoms. With its gentle movements and easy adaptability, yoga is perhaps the best form of exercise for rheumatoid arthritis patients. Just make sure to learn and practice poses in sequences that are shown to help with the condition. Yoga is not just recommended in Ayurveda, but is now often included as an adjunct treatment in conventional medicine. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4490021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Research shows<\/a> that arthritic patients can benefit from yoga, with improved mobility and fitness, as well as reduced stress levels. <br><br>For more comprehensive Ayurvedic treatment options, you should consult an Ayurvedic practitioner and consider undergoing <em>panchakarma<\/em>, which help to detoxify the body.
