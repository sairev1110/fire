To help stage patients and their treatments correctly, doctors use a four-stage classification of Congestive Heart Failure. Each stage is accompanied by certain mechanisms happening inside the body, but what really matters to us is what we can see outside, as symptoms and therefore, how seriously we need to take them.<\/p>\n<p>The stages of Congestive Heart Failure based on this approach are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 1:\u00a0<\/strong>Normal physical activity like walking or taking a flight of stairs does not lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, or palpitations. However, when you do any moderate exercise, like a brisk walk or a jog or taking four flights of stairs, you feel breathless or tired.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage 2:\u00a0<\/strong>You feel comfortable when you are resting. But as soon as you take a flight of stairs or walk a block, you may feel breathless or feel your heart race or feel tired.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage 3:\u00a0<\/strong>You feel okay till you\u2019re at rest. But even the simple task of getting up from the sofa and walking over to the kitchen causes makes you want to rest or pant or feel palpitations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Stage 4:\u00a0<\/strong>You feel your heart and breath faster even at rest, tire even though you are sitting and feel anxiety and palpitations almost all the time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As we said earlier, life expectancy and prognosis will vary according to the stage at which you are.

It has the ability to convert lactic acid, a waste product that the heart finds hard to handle when diseased, back into something called pyruvate, a perfect heart fuel. Unfortunately, its not freely available in the U.S., and in any case, your best bet is to work with a practitioner who can help you fine tune the dose most suitable for you.

This amazing compound, which is produced naturally in the human body, is critical for energy production at the cellular level. When your body runs low of CoQ10, all the muscles in the body feel the pain. The heart is our most important muscle and needs at least 10 times more CoQ10 than any other tissue of the body. But patients with CHF and other serious heart conditions are seen to be deficient in CoQ10. To add insult to injury, the very medications that are supposed to help the heart condition also steal CoQ10 from the human body. Beta blockers, vasodilators and statin drugs are notorious for depleting CoQ10 from patients. So everyone on medications for cardiac conditions should consider CoQ10 seriously.<br \/>\nThere is no dearth of literature to support CoQ10 supplementation for CHF patients. It is well tolerated by most and without side effects. A meta study of 420 patients published in the BMJ Open Heart Journal found that those who received CoQ10 at 100 mg thrice a day for two years were at a substantially lower risk of heart failure than those who received the placebo.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hawthorne_Berry\">Hawthorne Berry<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In Europe, Hawthorne berry has been studied extensively for its heart health benefits and is often used along with Digoxin to reduce the amount of that medication needed to help CHF patients.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.drsinatra.com\/natural-treatments-for-congestive-heart-failure\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Stephen Sinatra<\/a>, M.D. and Integrative Cardiologist, suggests a dose of \u201c500\u20131500 mg daily or take as a tincture in water three times daily\u201d for a CHF condition. You can get resources on the other natural supplements used by integrative cardiologists on his website.<\/p>\n<p>The Sepalika team has also put together a small list of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/3-little-known-awesome-heart-helpers\/\">three natural heart helpers<\/a>, but since Congestive Heart Failure is a serious condition, you must discuss this information and supporting research with your doctor before adding any supplements to your regimen.<\/p>\n<p>Also remember to print out and carry to your next doctor\u2019s appointment, the list of drugs commonly used for CHF and the nutrients they deplete over the long term. In another article, which we would very much want you to read, we\u2019ve talked about how these drugs deplete vital nutrients from your body which can give rise to many different health conditions. Discuss how you can put these nutrients back into your body, especially if you are feeling the symptoms of depletion we have described.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Congestive_Heart_Failure_And_EECP_The_Natural_Bypass\">Congestive Heart Failure And EECP: The Natural Bypass?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>EECP or Enhanced External Counter Pulsation is emerging as an alternative to conventional bypass surgery. Here, the patient lies down, while blood-pressure like cuffs are fixed to the thighs and calf muscles.<\/p>\n<p>When the heart rests between beats, the pressure cuffs inflate in sync, pushing blood back to the heart, creating fine collateral arteries to open up. The end result, usually after 35 sessions \u2013 is that your heart suddenly has new arteries supplying fresh blood to it.<\/p>\n<p>It is covered by insurance in several states in the U.S. and<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eecp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00a0eecp.com<\/a>\u00a0 can help you locate a therapy center near you and also determine if you are a fit candidate to receive the therapy. \u201cEven if you had to pay the $5,000 dollars out of pocket,\u201d says Dr. Cowan, in his book, \u201cit is certainly far safer than having your chest cracked open.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Congestive_Heart_Failure_Our_Parting_Thoughts\">Congestive Heart Failure: Our Parting Thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Congestive Heart Failure is a serious condition, no doubt.
