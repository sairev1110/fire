This is often due to pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a muscular valve that guards the opening of the esophagus into the stomach. While it allows food to enter the stomach, it does not allow stomach contents to flow back into the esophagus, unless it has become weakened. Esophageal tissue is not protected from the corrosive action of the acid by the thick mucosal layer that protects stomach tissue. Constant acid reflux, or the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, irritates these cells and can lead to cancer.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Symptoms_of_Esophageal_Cancer\">Symptoms of Esophageal Cancer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Cancer of the esophagus is discovered through a series of symptoms, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia<\/li>\n<li>Chest pain<\/li>\n<li>Weight loss<\/li>\n<li>Worsening heartburn<\/li>\n<li>Hoarseness<\/li>\n<li>Chronic cough<\/li>\n<li>Vomiting, sometimes containing blood<\/li>\n<li>Bone pain<\/li>\n<li>Pneumonia<\/li>\n<li>Esophageal bleeding, which appears as black stools<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most of us have had at least some of these symptoms, without having esophageal cancer. However, if you have a combination of these symptoms (especially when combined with difficulty in swallowing), it is important to see your doctor.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Types_of_Esophageal_Cancer_Which_One_Can_Be_Caused_By_GERD\">Types of Esophageal Cancer: Which One Can Be Caused By GERD<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19678\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Esopheagus-cancer.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19678\" class=\"wp-image-19678 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Esopheagus-cancer.webp\" alt=\"GERD and esophageal cancer\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19678\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">GERD and esophageal cancer<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Esophageal cancer is extremely aggressive, often fatal, and ranks sixth among cancers in mortality. While the number of people suffering from this condition has been steadily increasing, unfortunately, it is poorly understood and not studied enough.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"There_are_two_types_of_esophageal_cancers\">There are two types of esophageal cancers<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Squamous cell carcinoma and<\/li>\n<li>Adenocarcinoma.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Squamous_cell_carcinoma\">Squamous cell carcinoma<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Squamous cell carcinoma affects the flat cells (squamous epithelium) lining the esophagus. Smoking and heavy drinking increase the risk of this type of cancer. Adenocarcinoma affects the cells that produce and release fluids including mucus, that cover the inner lining of the digestive tract. <a href=\"http:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jama\/fullarticle\/194842\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GERD increases the risks<\/a> for this type of cancer, and GERD-induced adenocarcinoma has been on the rise in recent years.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Adenocarcinoma_Arises_from_Barretts_Esophagus_The_Crucial_Ignored_Link_To_GERD\">Adenocarcinoma Arises from Barrett\u2019s Esophagus: The Crucial Ignored Link To GERD<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Barrett\u2019s esophagus is an asymptomatic condition in which the cells of the lower esophagus are transformed into cells that are similar to those found in the intestinal tract. This poorly understood transformation is associated with chronic acid reflux over many years.<\/p>\n<p>One study on rats, with experimentally induced chronic reflux, hinted at a new mechanism in the development of Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Cytokines are small proteins that stimulate the mobilization of cells in the immune system. In an irritated esophagus, cytokines can cause a change in the structure and proliferation of cells and attract more inflammatory immune cells to the area. Thus, the inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) could be due to cytokines secreted by squamous cells in response to contact with stomach acid, rather than the caustic effects of the acid itself, as had been previously thought.<\/p>\n<p>Barrett\u2019s esophagus can occur for a variety of reasons but GERD increases the chances of developing this condition by 3 to 5 times. Between 5 and 10 percent of people with GERD develop Barrett\u2019s esophagus, with men twice as likely as women to do so. The condition usually develops after the age of 55.<\/p>\n<p>Adenocarcinomas usually start at the end of the esophagus closest to the stomach, which makes sense since this is the area that is most exposed to the acid reflux sloshing back acidic contents of the stomach.<\/p>\n<p>Patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus have a 50 to 100 times greater risk of developing esophageal cancer than the general population.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_You_Must_Screen_For_Barrets_If_You_Have_GERD\">Why You Must Screen For Barret\u2019s If You Have GERD<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>People who have GERD for many years should be screened by endoscopy for Barrett\u2019s esophagus. Endoscopy involves the insertion of a thin, flexible tube with a camera on its tip, into the mouth. The tube is swallowed, so that the entire esophagus, right up to the beginning of the stomach can be seen by the doctor. Barrett\u2019s esophagus appears on the endoscope as salmon pink colored patches within a whitish pink tissue.<\/p>\n<p>There is no cure for Barrett\u2019s esophagus, and the risk of cancer associated with it cannot be decreased. Therefore, it is important to treat GERD so that Barrett\u2019s esophagus does not develop in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Once esophageal cancer develops, conventional treatment is limited to radiation and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, due to its aggressive nature, the prognosis isn\u2019t good. \u00a0According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/esophagus-cancer\/detection-diagnosis-staging\/survival-rates.html\">American Cancer Society<\/a>, 5-year survival rates range between 40% and 4%, depending on the stage at which it is detected.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>GERD is more than a simple heartburn. That it can cause a disease as frightening and life threatening as cancer is proof of it. Esophageal cancer is aggressive and lethal. You can, however, treat GERD and therefore minimize the risks of esophageal cancer. GERD is a digestive imbalance and can be controlled through a combination of dietary and lifestyle modifications, as well as effective medications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Constant acid reflux, or the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, irritates these cells and can lead to cancer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85,"featured_media":19680,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[14,31],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>GERD And Esophageal Cancer: The Scary, Real Connection | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The connection between GERD and esophageal cancer is real.
