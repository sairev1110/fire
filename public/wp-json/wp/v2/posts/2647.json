Lots of poisons start out being thought of as God\u2019s gift to mankind.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18655\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/cocaine-banner-11.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18655\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18655\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/cocaine-banner-11.webp\" alt=\"how to stop sugar cravings\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18655\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">how to stop sugar cravings<\/p><\/div>\n<p>See the kids in the ad? Well, it is estimated that today, a child has more sugar by the time she is 8 years old than an adult would have had in an entire lifetime just one century ago!<\/p>\n<p>Sugar significantly raises levels of dopamine, one of our feel-good neurotransmitters, in the reward centers of our brain. Recent research carried out at Queensland University of Technology in Australia found that the more sugar you eat, the more it decreases dopamine levels and so the more you crave it.\u00a0 People \u201cneed to consume higher and higher levels of how to stop sugar cravings in order to reach the same reward levels and avoid mild states of depression\u201d, researchers say.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Sugars_just_the_white_table_stuff_right_Wrong\">Sugar\u2019s just the white table stuff, right? Wrong!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When we\u2019re talking sugar and addiction, we need to know it not just about the obvious, sweet tasting foods like desserts. All carbohydrate-based foods, like bread, cereals, grains, crackers, pasta and potatoes end up as sugar in the body.\u00a0 And its not that all these foods are all bad &#8211; it\u2019s more a matter of balance.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Food_companies_have_you_hooked\">Food companies have you \u201chooked\u201d<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Food manufacturers and food chains invest large sums researching the \u201csweet-spot\u201d for sugar in foods.\u00a0 Get in the right amount and it conveys a \u201ccrave\u201d message to our brain and taste buds are hooked.<\/p>\n<p>Even savory snacks and takeaway foods are often crammed with sugar. <strong>Would you believe that fries, breads and crackers, that have a predominantly salty taste, are still laced with sugar?<\/strong> Food companies put it there, knowing it is addictive \u2013 the more you want, the more you buy, and the bigger their profits.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Artificial_sugars_Chemical_cocktail_to_increase_shelf_life\">Artificial sugars: Chemical cocktail to increase shelf life<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In fact, most processed food is \u201cdenatured\u201d \u2013 meaning, the natural sugars are first removed from the food. This is done to increase shelf life, because natural sugars spoil fast. Once the natural sugars are removed from the food, it doesn\u2019t taste as good any more, which means you will never get addicted and they can\u2019t sell it to you by the ton. So, they add back artificial sugars \u2013 chemicals that don\u2019t spoil easily. Now you know why you don\u2019t get addicted to natural honey in the same way you get addicted to processed sugars in donuts and cereal and biscuits and everything else.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Your_brain_on_sugar_Not_easy_to_kick_the_addiction\">Your brain on sugar: Not easy to kick the addiction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not easy. Due mostly to the hormones dopamine and insulin being in overdrive when we\u2019re on a steady diet of sugar-laden foods, our brains are wired to prevent us from kicking the habit. The addiction to sugar is so strong that the body sends out powerful signals to keep feeding it \u2013 the craving for sugar is huge.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Bartlet from Queensland University of Technology notes, <strong>&#8220;Like other drugs of abuse, withdrawal from chronic sugar exposure can result in an imbalance in dopamine levels.\u201d<\/strong> This could cause symptoms such as fatigue, cravings, lethargy and even shakes and irritability.\u00a0 The good news is, a few days of determination will have the habit dampened and with the right tools you can get rid of it permanently.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"6_Easy_Ways_on_How_to_Stop_Sugar_Cravings\">6 Easy Ways on How to Stop Sugar Cravings<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18657\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Scrambled-Eggs.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18657\" class=\"wp-image-18657 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Scrambled-Eggs.webp\" alt=\" what deficiency causes sugar cravings\" width=\"650\" height=\"350\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18657\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">what deficiency causes sugar cravings<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"1_Diet_Focus_on_what_you_CAN_eat_have_a_long_list\">1. Diet: Focus on what you CAN eat; have a long list<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Instead of concentrating on what you can\u2019t eat, focus on what you can.\u00a0 Foods containing proteins, healthy fats and fibre (vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds especially) slow down the release of sugars into the blood, keep you feeling fuller for longer and are satisfying in way that they take away the constant need to reach for sugary snacks.\u00a0 They also increase nutrients to help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/14-amazing-herbs-that-lower-blood-sugar\/\">balance blood sugar<\/a> and neurotransmitters, stop the mood and energy swings and detoxify your system in general.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Include_fiber_protein_and_healthy_fats_at_every_meal_and_snack\">2. Include fiber, protein and healthy fats at every meal and snack<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Here are some ideas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scrambled egg and avocado on wholemeal toast<\/li>\n<li>A handful of nuts, or a trail mix<\/li>\n<li>Salmon with salad drizzled with olive oil (in a sandwich if you prefer)<\/li>\n<li>Chicken stir-fry with coconut oil and brown rice<\/li>\n<li>Apple slices spread with nut butter (make sure there is no added sugar in the nut butter)<\/li>\n<li>Almond meal pancakes with banana and strawberries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Upping the ante on proteins, fiber and fats is a no-brainer option on how to stop sugar addiction.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Start_the_day_well\">3. Start the day well<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ditch the sweetened cereal and toast at breakfast time \u2013 these are chock-full of sugar which means you start the day on a sugar high that will come crashing down about an hour later and see you searching around for the next hit.<\/p>\n<p>Instead try:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eggs with spinach and tomato (you can add in wholemeal toast here)<\/li>\n<li>Whole oats with a drizzle of flaxseed oil and berries or banana for natural sweetness<\/li>\n<li>Breakfast smoothie with fruit, plain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/yogurt-vs-milk-treat-acid-relux\/\">yogurt<\/a>, flax oil, silken tofu or a raw free-range egg<\/li>\n<li>Bircher muesli with seeds, unsweetened yogurt and berries<\/li>\n<li>Wholemeal toast with sliced tomato, olive oil, sea salt and ricotta<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"4_If_it_comes_in_a_packet_think_twice\">4. If it comes in a packet, think twice<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Eat whole foods (not the brand, the real \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201centire\u201d foods). Generally, foods that require a plastic wrapping are heavily processed and contain added sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.\u00a0 Avoid these as much as possible and instead choose foods as close to their natural state as possible such as vegetables, fruits, free-range animal products, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s not as easy as walking into a supermarket, but if you make the effort to go to the local farmer\u2019s market to buy fresh produce, your body will thank you. Trust us \u2013 you will be amazed at how different fresh food can smell and taste.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"5_Use_healthy_sugar_alternatives_with_care\">5. Use healthy \u201csugar alternatives\u201d with care<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of hype at the moment about using ingredients such as rice malt syrup, maple syrup, coconut sugar etc. instead of table sugar; while these products are slightly less processed and do contain more nutrients, be aware that they are still sugar and have the same effect in the body so use them sparingly.<\/p>\n<p>Say an absolute no to artificial sweeteners like saccharin.\u00a0<strong>Queensland University of Technology found that these artificial sweeteners produce effects similar to those obtained with table sugar; they are also high in dangerous chemicals, so avoid them completely.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The one exception may be naturally derived stevia, which has been shown to have beneficial effects on the pancreas and doesn\u2019t spike blood sugar or increase insulin or dopamine levels. And sorry to say this again, but this does not mean you can go ahead and use stevia in everything; it is still a sugar.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"6_Dietary_nutrients_to_help_you_kick_the_sugar_habit\">6. Dietary nutrients to help you kick the sugar habit<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Chromium_Picolinate\">Chromium Picolinate<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>200-400mcg daily.\u00a0 Chromium enhances the action of insulin, decreases <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/weight-loss-after-forty-how-to-deal-with-insulin-resistance-and-lose-weight\/\">insulin resistance <\/a>and aids the transport of glucose into cells. It\u2019s a big one when it comes to reducing sugar cravings.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Magnesium\">Magnesium<strong>\u00a0 <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>400mg per day \u2013 relaxes muscles, makes them more amenable to accepting sugar, reduces insulin resistance and enhances blood glucose control<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Gymnema_Sylvestre\">Gymnema Sylvestre<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>400-600mg per day &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/gymnema-sylvestre-diabetes\/\">Gymnema <\/a>suppresses the sweet taste of sugar thus taking away the pleasurable aspect of sweet foods.\u00a0 It also enhances the action of insulin and helps control blood sugar.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cinnamon\">Cinnamon<strong>\u00a0 <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>1 teaspoon in a hot drink or meal 2 times a day helps with blood sugar control and stops sugar cravings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 \u201cSugar\u201d \u2013 More Addictive Than Cocaine2 Sugar\u2019s just the white table stuff, right?
