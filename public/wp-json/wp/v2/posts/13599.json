Then Dong Quai is a must-add to your collection of remedies for PCOS. In traditional Chinese medicine, Dong Quai is to women\u2019s health what Ginseng is to men\u2019s health. In other words, it\u2019s known to be the most potent herb to promote fertility. It also helps in normalizing menstrual cycle and restoring hormonal balance.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Does_Dong_Quai_Work_For_PCOS\">How Does Dong Quai Work For PCOS?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Any competent Chinese herbalist will recommend Dong Quai for PCOS. A well-guarded secret in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, Dong Quai root acts as a uterine tonic. Not only will it ensure regular periods and bring about hormonal balance, but it also boosts immunity and improves your chances of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/false-unicorn-root-fertility\/\">getting pregnant<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To understand how Dong Quai root helps PCOS, we have to first understand the basics. In women with PCOS, Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is out of whack. As the name suggests, FSH\u00a0stimulates the ovarian follicle so a mature egg can grow. This encourages estrogen production in the follicle, which signals the pituitary gland to start producing LH. It\u2019s only when LH is produced that a mature egg is released, leading to normal ovulation. Low levels of LH leads to \u2018estrogen dominance\u2019 wherein the follicle may not fully mature, causing cystic ovaries.<\/p>\n<p>Dong Quai root improves the blood flow to the pelvis. This\u00a0helps in balancing hormones and strengthening the uterus. This in-turn eases the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/fight-off-chronic-inflammation-naturally\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">inflammation<\/a>, prevents stagnation and also stimulates regular periods. This herbal tonic also helps ease many of the undesired effects of PCOS. These effects include menstrual pain, cramps, bloating, and uterine muscle weakness.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Is_There_Research_To_Support_Dong_Quai_Root_For_PCOS\">Is There Research To Support Dong Quai Root For PCOS?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Dong Quai (scientific name: Angelica sinensis) has been nicknamed \u201cfemale ginseng\u201d by the Western world. It was first introduced in 1899 by Merck as \u2018Eumenol.\u2019 It was designed to treat menstrual cramps and pain. While it was discontinued in 1946, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ema.europa.eu\/docs\/en_GB\/document_library\/Herbal_-_HMPC_assessment_report\/2013\/11\/WC500155549.pdf\">researchers<\/a> are trying to uncover the benefits of Dong Quai for female reproductive health.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ptr.1928\/full\">rat studies<\/a>, Dong Quai has been shown to promote estrogen levels. <a href=\"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/menopausejournal\/Abstract\/2002\/03000\/Estrogenic_activity_of_herbs_commonly_used_as.10.aspx\">Scientists<\/a> are still studying the estrogenic activity of Dong Quai and trying to identify the compounds in this herb. It contains phytoestrogens or dietary estrogens, which exhibit mild estrogenic actions. This explains why Dong Quai Root can be used for longer periods\u00a0when compared to other herbal tonics.<\/p>\n<p>However, Dong Quai root\u2019s hormonal-mimicking effects are unclear as yet. Additionally, there is a lack of clinical data demonstrating the potential side effects of Dong Quai. Further studies are needed to understand its efficacy and the potential for adverse effects.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Get_To_Know_Dong_Quai\">Get To Know Dong Quai<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In Chinese medicine, Dong Quai is used for the treatment of a whole range of gynecological conditions. It is indicated to be a \u2018blood tonic\u2019 that purifies the blood and improves blood circulation. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that period irregularities are caused by \u2018stagnation\u2019 of the reproductive organs. This stagnation results in absent or missing periods. By increasing blood flow to the female reproductive system, Dong Quai helps in reducing congestion and pain.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s believed that this herbal root can be helpful in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Balancing estrogen levels<\/li>\n<li>Tone a weak uterus by promoting metabolism within the organ<\/li>\n<li>Easing inflammation<\/li>\n<li>Regulating hormonal control<\/li>\n<li>Improving the rhythm of the menstrual cycle<\/li>\n<li>Treat delayed or absent periods<\/li>\n<li>Treat premenstrual syndrome (PMS)<\/li>\n<li>Ease menstrual cramps and pain<\/li>\n<li>Help with menopausal symptoms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Using_Dong_Quai_Root_For_PCOS\">Using Dong Quai Root For PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20222\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Using-Dong-Quai-Root-For-PCOS.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20222\" class=\"wp-image-20222 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Using-Dong-Quai-Root-For-PCOS.webp\" alt=\"Dong Quai for PCOS\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20222\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Using Dong Quai Root For PCOS<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Dong Quai is available in many forms.
