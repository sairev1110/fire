Exercise needs energy. Energy is made from sugar. You exercise, your blood sugar goes down. Simple. So there is a strong connection between exercise and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/14-amazing-herbs-that-lower-blood-sugar\/\">diabetes sugar levels<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond this simple understanding, exercise has shown to improve the \u201cinsulin resistance\u201d of cells, allowing for more sugar to enter the cells, where it belongs, rather than floating in your blood, where it does not.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, stress and diabetes are often connected. When you exercise, your body produces endorphins, \u201cfeel good\u201d chemicals that help de-stress. Lesser stress = Lesser stress hormones = Less rapid sugar poured into the blood stream to combat to handle stress.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Getting_Started\"><span id=\"Getting_Started\">Getting Started!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It may seem like a challenge right now, but with the right precautions, a sound fitness plan will soon set you on the road to optimum health.\u00a0You can also include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/yoga-for-diabetes\/\">yoga exercise for diabetes<\/a> in your physical routine.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Be_Safe\"><span id=\"Be_Safe\">Be Safe<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Always get your doctor\u2019s okay before you start an exercise regimen. Get assessed for any conditions that may contraindicate certain types of exercise or result in injury. Keep in mind your age and your previous physical activity level before you begin. This is especially important if: Bottom of Form<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are older than age 35.<\/li>\n<li>Have had diabetes for more than 10 years.<\/li>\n<li>Have any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/type-2-diabetes-complications\/\">complication<\/a> of diabetes.<\/li>\n<li>Have not exercised in a long time, or have heart disease.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To begin with, exercise has the same effect on blood glucose as insulin. It lowers blood glucose, making you more sensitive to insulin. This is a benefit of exercise that can also pose a problem, if it lowers your blood glucose too much. If you use injected insulin or are on oral diabetic medications, then there is a greater risk of the blood glucose going too low, a condition called hypoglycemia. Don\u2019t let this scare you. You have to start someday, so we\u2019re going to break it down for you and let you get started with all the proper safeguards in place.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Hypoglycemia_Or_Low_Blood_sugar_How_to_Avoid_it\"><span id=\"Hypoglycemia_Or_Low_Blood_sugar_How_to_Avoid_it\">Hypoglycemia Or Low Blood sugar: How to Avoid it<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><strong>What if Blood Glucose is Less Than 70mg\/dL<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test your blood glucose before and after exercise, especially when you are starting out.<\/li>\n<li>Have at least 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate with you to treat low blood glucose, should it happen.

Diabetics are especially prone to dehydration and getting into a dehydrated state can impact blood glucose levels and heart function adversely. Drink plenty of liquids prior to physical activity. (e.g., 17 ounces of fluid consumed two hours before physical activity). If you have any kidney issues, discuss things with your doctor before you increase water intake, to protect your kidneys. Have fluid frequently to compensate for losses in sweat.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Foot_Care\"><span id=\"Foot_Care\">Foot Care<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Diabetics can often lose sensation to some degree in their feet either as the disease progresses or because their medication is stealing vital nutrients from their body, leading to nerve damage.
