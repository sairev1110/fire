These pills are given to regulate their menstrual cycles. These drugs are also used to treat acne and facial hair in such women, since they often have high levels of male hormones. Hormone pills, with the hormones estrogen and progestin are what doctor\u2019s reach for when women come in with symptoms of PCOD. \u00a0These can be in the form of the well-known \u201cpill,\u201d (oral contraceptive), or vaginal rings or skin patches.<\/p>\n<p>Important Note: This article is about how birth control pills work when conventional doctors give them to women with PCOS. We DON\u2019T believe this is a cure for PCOS. We believe the root cause of PCOD is something else. Fixing that is what fixes PCOD.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Possible_Medical_Benefits_of_Birth_Control_Pills_in_PCOS\">Possible Medical Benefits of Birth Control Pills in PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Young women with PCOD who take oral contraceptive pills could benefit from:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Regular but lighter periods<\/li>\n<li>Less facial and body hair<\/li>\n<li>Clearer skin (acne reduces)<\/li>\n<li>Lesser or no menstrual cramping and pain<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/side-effects-birth-control-pills\/\">Birth Control Pills Side Effects<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Do_Birth_Control_Pills_Help_Women_with_PCOS\">How Do Birth Control Pills Help Women with PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/5897059\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A 1965 study<\/a> found that if women took medicines called \u201covulation inhibitors\u201d, they reduced the activity of male hormones in their body. These medicines reduce the number of follicles produced in a woman\u2019s body, something that happens between Day 1-15 from the start of the period.<\/p>\n<p>All women have a delicate balance of two hormones \u2013 progesterone and estrogen. Progesterone reduces ovulation. It also reduces male hormones. So, when women complained of facial hair, acne and other things caused by excess male hormones, they were given progestin (progesterone-like compounds). This helped. With time, a more sophisticated pill was developed, that combined progesterone and estrogen both, to treat women with irregular periods.<\/p>\n<p>These drugs reduce the number of follicles by 1) interfering with signals sent by the brain to the ovaries or 2) interfering with the ovaries themselves.<\/p>\n<p>This therapy has one more additional benefit for PCOD sufferers. It can protect her from uterine cancer. When a woman isn\u2019t ovulating (releasing an egg from a follicle) regularly, she does not have normal periods. This leads to abnormal thickening of the uterine lining. This is called \u201c<em>endometrial hyperplasia<\/em>.\u201d This increases the risks of uterine cancer. The progestin\/progesterone in birth control pills helps prevent this.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Popular_Types_of_Hormonal_Birth_Control\">Popular Types of Hormonal Birth Control<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are different options to choose from.

They can be either combination pills (having two hormones, progesterone\/progestin and estrogen) or they can be progestin-only. Combination pills usually come as 21-day or 28-day packs. You can take these pills once a day at any time that suits you. You can start taking the pills from the first day of your period or within 5 days from the day your period starts.<\/p>\n<p>Progestin-only pills, also called \u201cmini pills,\u201d have to be taken within the same three hours every day. These come in 28-day packs. You can start taking these pills at any time but remember that pregnancy protection with these pills begins after 48 hours.<\/p>\n<p>A birth control patch is used by sticking it to clean, dry skin on your belly, upper outer arm, buttocks or back. (Caution \u2013 NEVER stick a birth control patch on your breasts!) Wear the patch for 7 days, remove it on the eighth day and apply a new one in its place. Do this for three weeks straight. In the fourth week, you\u2019ll get your period. You aren\u2019t supposed to wear a patch in the fourth week. Apply a new patch immediately after your patch-free week.<\/p>\n<p>A vaginal ring is a small flexible rubber ring that releases a constant amount of hormones that the blood vessels in your vagina absorb. Gently insert it into the vagina and let it remain there for 21 days (3 weeks). You have to remove the ring after three weeks on the same day you had inserted it (If you had inserted the ring on a Monday, you have to remove it on the fourth Monday).<\/p>\n<p>Stop using the ring for one week (the fourth week). You won\u2019t get your regular periods when you are using the ring. You will, however, bleed lightly. This is called \u201cwithdrawal bleed.\u201d It happens because you aren\u2019t taking the hormones during the ring-free week. In some women, it might not happen at all. After the ring-free week, insert a new ring (on the eighth day) and continue the cycle. Remember to insert a new ring starting the new week even if you are still bleeding.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-healthy-pregnancy\/\">PCOS And Healthy Pregnancy: Everything You Need To Know!<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Safety_and_Precautions_for_Using_Oral_Contraceptive_Pills\">Safety and Precautions for Using Oral Contraceptive Pills<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Your doctor will need to regularly check you for any unwanted side effects while you are on this treatment. Tell your doctor if you are allergic to any of the compounds in the pill or have any other kind of allergies. You need to tell the attending doctor that you are taking oral contraceptive pills before any kind of emergency treatment or surgery.<\/p>\n<p>You need inform your doctor about any health condition you might have or had in the past before starting with oral contraceptives.

There has been no study that compares them with each other for safety or efficacy for PCOS. If you decide to go with birth control pills for your PCOS, your doctor will help you choose. Again, please note: we don\u2019t think birth control pills solve the root cause of PCOD. That involves diet and lifestyle changes. Even if you choose to use tablets, dietary supplements and herbals may have fewer side effects than birth control pills.<\/p>\n<p>Managing PCOD can be tricky, especially if you just try to treat individual symptoms with medicines. Oral contraceptives are effective to an extent in helping a woman with some of her symptoms. Unfortunately, there are long-term complications that can do more harm than PCOS itself.<\/p>\n<p>While doctors will prescribe drugs to treat symptoms, you will be pleasantly surprised to know that lifestyle changes can have a huge impact on many aspects of your PCOD. For example, if you are overweight or obese, losing weight can help regulate your menstrual cycles as well as help reduce your insulin resistance. So, if you look at PCOD from a holistic perspective, you\u2019ll realize that diet, lifestyle changes and managing everyday stress will go a long way in helping you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/treat-pcos-naturally-inspiring-success-story\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">reverse this condition<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Possible Medical Benefits of Birth Control Pills in PCOS2 How Do Birth Control Pills Help Women with PCOS3 Popular Types of Hormonal Birth Control3.1 Oral contraceptive pills (\u201cthe pill\u201d)3.2 Skin Patch3.3 Vaginal Ring3.4 Injection4 How To Use Birth Control Pills5 Safety and Precautions for Using Oral Contraceptive Pills6 Do Oral Contraceptives Interact [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85,"featured_media":20180,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[145,143],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How Useful are Birth Control Pills for PCOS? | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Birth control pills or oral contraceptive pills are given to women with PCOS.
