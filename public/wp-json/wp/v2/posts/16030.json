We agree that \u201cimmune system booster\u201d can help us live in good health and fight off diseases. As we age, this becomes increasingly difficult. According to the Harvard Medical School, \u201cResearchers believe that the aging process somehow leads to a reduction of immune response capability, which in turn contributes to more infections, more inflammatory diseases, and more cancer.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_Does_Immunity_Need_Boosting\">Why Does Immunity Need \u201cBoosting\u201d?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As we age, the same everyday factors like stress, poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle, poor sleep, and the overuse of prescription medication begin to catch up with us. Before we know it, we have the perfect storm brewing. Researchers are yet to identify the single \u201csmoking gun;\u201d everything from reduction of T-cell function (immune system booster) to immune cell death is being investigated as the cause of low immunity.<\/p>\n<p>Holistic systems of medicine that are thousand of years old from China and India postulate that living in overly sanitized environments, such as the U.S., leads to immune compromise. Immune systems out of balance may explain the higher incidence of allergies and autoimmune diseases in the West.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Can_We_Do\">What Can We Do?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The simple things we can do to keep our immunity strong remain timeless; eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, drink in moderation, do not smoke, get regular exercise, and get preventive checkups regularly as appropriate for your age.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Do_We_Need_Supplements\">Do We Need Supplements?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The food we eat simply does not have the nutrients it used to have. Widespread use of chemicals in agriculture has robbed the soil of necessary micronutrients.\u00a0Many developed nations are discovering that people suffer from \u201cmicronutrient malnutrition\u201d due to this soil depletion and other factors.<\/p>\n<p>We face the brunt of this even more severely as we age. According to the World Health Organization, <em>\u201c<\/em>Micronutrient deficiencies are often common in elderly people due to a number of factors, such as their reduced food intake and a lack of variety in the foods they eat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In fact, \u201cMicronutrient Malnutrition\u201d is one of the key avenues of research into how aging may compromise immune function.<\/p>\n<p>Supplementing vital nutrients\u2014such as vitamins, minerals, and enzymes\u2014must always be done with medical supervision, especially in the elderly. And when done right, the difference this can make to boost immunity and overall health can be remarkable!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"So_Many_Choices_What_to_Pick\">So Many Choices: What to Pick?<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18384\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Supplements-for-Immunity.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18384\" class=\"wp-image-18384 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Supplements-for-Immunity.webp\" alt=\"immune system booster - supplements for boosting immunity\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18384\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">how to be more fertile<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The divine dozen!<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"A_Good_Multivitamin\">A Good Multivitamin<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In his book, \u201cThe Supplement Pyramid,\u201d Dr. Michael Smith puts a high-quality multi-vitamin at the absolute \u201cfoundation\u201d of good health. A twice-a-day supplement with high-quality ingredients, taken with major meals, can help augment nutrition from your food in a very big way. Get a good product, with the least fillers, at a good price. The old saying holds true that \u201cthe most expensive supplement is the one that does you no good.\u201d <em>What seems to work for many: 1 tablet, twice a day.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vitamin_D\">Vitamin D<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A vitamin whose 15 seconds in the sun has lasted for years now\u2026 and rightly so! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/vitamin-d-and-diabetes\/\">Vitamin D<\/a>, as measured in most standard blood tests, is a \u201cpre-hormone,\u201d which means that it is converted into a hormone and interacts with several other hormones in the body to ensure your great immune system booster. Some cutting-edge doctors like to dose this vitamin at 50,000 IU per day during acute flu attacks, but most agree that 60,000 IU per week is a safe dose for a majority of people. <em>What seems to work for many: 60,000 IU per week<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Omega-3_Fatty_Acids\">Omega-3 Fatty Acids<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve all heard of fish oil and how the Japanese seem to be in excelled heart health because of it. Well that\u2019s not all that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/omega-3-fatty-acids-types-benefits\/\">omega-3 fatty acids<\/a> are good for. They work by lowering inflammation in your body. Low-grade, long-term inflammation\u2014i.e, a body that is always on high alert\u2014is an immune system out of balance. Get these good fats in to keep out depression, as well as lower cardiac risk and increase cognitive function.\u00a0<em>What seems to work for many: 3 g a day<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Probiotics\">Probiotics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>90% of the 100 trillion cells in our body belong to other microscopic creatures. They live everywhere\u2014especially in our gut\u2014and govern our immune reactions. That means if they are the right friendly kind, that\u2019s 90% of the immunity battle won! Look for products with 10\u201320 billion CFUs (colony-forming units) per capsule, and 6\u20137 strains (types) of bacteria in them. <em>What seems to work for many: 1 capsule, 20 billion CFU a day.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Vitamin_C\">Vitamin C<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The vitamin that formed the core of 2-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling. He attributed his longevity to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/benefits-vitamin-c\/\">vitamin C <\/a>(he lived in great health to the age of 93). This humble vitamin lays claim to being useful across the spectrum of human health\u2014from shortening the duration of the common cold episodes to helping to prevent and even retard cancer &#8211; a true immune booster. Doses as high as 10 grams a day have been used safely, though 1\u20132 grams is seen to produce safe benefits with minimal side effects (runny tummy). <em>What seems to work for many: 1 g a day.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ashwagandha\">Ashwagandha<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger! Plants that grow under extremely stressful conditions (harsh weather, sunlight, extreme temperatures, etc.) are forced to evolve survival mechanisms. They become extraordinarily skilled at tolerating stress and become champion immune boosters. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/ashwagandha-the-one-must-have-herb-for-all-of-us\/\">Ashwagandha<\/a>, an Ayurvedic herb from the Indian Himalayas, is known to lower anxiety, stress, and harmful chemicals in the blood. It\u2019s an immune system modulator that\u2019s been used for centuries. <em>What seems to work for many: 300\u2013500g 3 times a day.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Zinc\">Zinc<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A mineral with a strong connection to our immune health, zinc levels can decline in the human body with age. \u201cImmunosenescence\u201d is the term doctors use to describe gradual decline of the immune system with age. Supplementing with zinc can help to combat this. At the first sign of a scratchy throat, many folks still reach for those zinc pills, and it seems to work like a charm!\u00a0<em>What seems to work for many: 50 mg a day. <\/em>A word of caution: Long-term use of zinc at this dose can lead to copper loss from the body, so take a break from it every now and then.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Selenium\">Selenium<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This potent antioxidant can help turn up immune function in people with compromised immune systems. At around 200 mcg, taken along with 400 IU of vitamin E complex, it packs a 1\u20132 punch that can improve thyroid function, a very important determinant of overall health.\u00a0<em>What seems to work for many: 200 mcg with 400 IU of vitamin E complex.<\/em> Diabetics should check with their doctor before dosing selenium.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Astragalus\">Astragalus<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18385\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Untitled-design-12.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18385\" class=\"wp-image-18385 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Untitled-design-12.webp\" alt=\"immunity booster for covid\" width=\"1200\" height=\"550\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18385\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Astragalus<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Another Eastern herb, used for hundreds of years, astragalus is a potent activator of T cells in the immune system. A go-to herb in Chinese medicine for colds and upper respiratory tract infections, it is well worthy of inclusion in our top dozen.\u00a0<em>What seems to work for many: 1 g a day.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"CoQ10\">CoQ10<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/immunity\/coq10-nutrient-for-boosting-immunity\/\">Coenzyme Q10<\/a> helps every cell in the body with energy production, and it also protects cells from oxidative stress. It mops up free radicals and prevents damage, helping the immune system function more smoothly. Your heart will thank you big time for this vitamin-like substance, since it is the primary fuel for heart muscle!\u00a0<em>What seems to work for many: 200 mg a day.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Beta_Glucans\">Beta Glucans<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Found naturally in things like baker\u2019s yeast and shiitake mushrooms, beta glucans have been used traditionally in Japan and other eastern countries to boost immune activity\u2014namely through stimulating white blood cells. Upper respiratory infections respond well to beta glucans, and they are known to even make antibiotic drugs more effective, thereby lowering the dose you need. <em>What seems to work for many: 200 mg of Beta 1,3\/1,6 D-Glucan.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Bovine_Colostrum\">Bovine Colostrum<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The first milk from a cow after she births is a fantastic immune booster, full of probiotics and immune factors that help humans. It works to seal our \u201cleaky gut,\u201d a condition that can otherwise let large food particles enter the bloodstream and cause immune havoc. It also neutralizes viruses by attracting them to itself and rendering them inert. <em><em>What seems to work for many: 1,500\u20133,000 mg.<\/em><\/em><\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s the immune-boosting dozen we use.
