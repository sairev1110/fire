This means crops no longer have the minerals and vitamins at the levels they once did. Our increased consumption of highly processed foods, our sedentary lifestyle choices, side effects of prescription medications and high concentrations of stress \u2013 all work against us.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Fatal_Flaw_Of_RDAs_Key_Goal_Is_Only_to_Avoid_Deficiency_Diseases\">Fatal Flaw Of RDAs: Key Goal Is Only to Avoid Deficiency Diseases<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18497\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/cs-asthma-nutrients-help-1440x810-1.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18497\" class=\"size-large wp-image-18497\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/cs-asthma-nutrients-help-1440x810-1-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"Key Goal Is Only to Avoid Deficiency Diseases\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Key Goal Is Only to Avoid Deficiency Diseases<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Beyond all the above, RDA standards were created with the aim of preventing deficiencies that would lead to certain serious health conditions. For example, Vitamin D deficiency is determined when a vitamin D metabolite falls below 12 ng\/mL in a blood sample. A person may show symptoms of the disease called Rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults. The latter involves serious softening of bones and severe<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/arthritis\/suffering-from-arthritis-its-time-to-adopt-the-anti-inflammatory-diet\/\"> joint pains<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So the RDA was determined by asking the question: \u201cHow much vitamin D should a person receive daily to prevent the development of Rickets and Osteomalacia?\u201d In this case, the level determined was 12 ng\/mL. If an individual had a vitamin D level of say, 16 ng\/mL, they would not be diagnosed as \u201cdeficient in vitamin D\u201d by a practitioner, and therefore, not prescribed a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/vitamin-d-and-diabetes\/\">vitamin D supplement<\/a> or asked to bask in the sun.<\/p>\n<p>Experts, however, believe that optimal levels of this key vitamin run a lot higher, say between 30 and 50 ng\/mL. They say that Vitamin D levels below 30 ng\/mL are insufficient\u00a0because, at these levels, the vitamin is unable to do its job of promoting health and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/diet-nutrition-reversing-chronic-disease\/\">preventing several chronic diseases<\/a> from developing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"quote-text-new\">RDA does not take into account recommended daily allowance of Nutrients insufficiencies \u2013 levels at which the nutrient is not fully deficient, but it is still unable to do any health-promoting tasks.<\/div>\n<p>This is often not a fixed number but an evolving target, based on what ongoing fresh research reveals.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Often_Is_RDA_Revised\">How Often Is RDA Revised?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Changes to RDA include new levels for iron and protein as referred to in 2001. A more recent change is the recommended daily value for vitamin D, changed in 2010. The new adequate blood level for vitamin D has been raised to 20 ng\/mL from 12 ng\/mL.
