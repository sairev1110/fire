Even though it\u2019s a common disorder, interestingly, many of us are not aware of certain important facts about the history of the condition and how it affects the body. Let\u2019s look at 18 interesting facts about diabetes.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-11446 img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Areteo_di_Cappadocia-from-Wikipedia.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><em>Image Courtesy:Wikipedia<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The literal meaning of diabetes is \u201cflowing through\u201d. The name, given by Greek Physician Aretaeus, originates from a noticeable increase in the urine frequency of patients. In fact, increased urine frequency is the first-ever identified symptom of diabetes, more than 1200 years ago. Given the excessive urination associated with the condition, at one point it was known as \u2018Pissing Evil.\u2019<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-11449 img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Kidney.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><br \/>\nSince it is characterized by frequent urination, diabetes was considered a kidney disease until the 18th century. It was first mentioned in 1500 BC in Egyptian manuscripts.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><br \/>\n<img class=\"wp-image-11440 img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/thomas-willis-Thefamouspeople.com_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><em>Image Courtesy: Thefamous people.com<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The full name of the condition is \u2018Diabetes Mellitus.\u2019 The term mellitus was coined by Thomas Willis the late 1600s. Dr. Willis, an English physician, was also the founding member of the Royal Society, the world\u2019s oldest scientific academy. Mellitus means sweetened honey. Since the urine of a diabetic is sweet, the word mellitus was added to its name.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone img-responsive wp-image-11441\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Diabetes-Test-in-okd-days.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><br \/>\nInterestingly, in old times, diabetes was diagnosed by tasting the patient\u2019s urine for sweetness. A group of people, known as \u2018water-testers\u2019, specialized in the process. Back then, there was another simple way of diagnosing diabetes, which again was based on sweetness of the urine. The urine of a suspected diabetic was observed to check whether any ants or flies collected around it. If they did, it was believed the patient had diabetes.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone img-responsive wp-image-11450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Pancreas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><\/p>\n<p>Diabetics face two main complications: Either their pancreas don\u2019t produce enough insulin, or they produce enough but their cells are unable to utilize it. Both complications result in excess sugar in the blood. Although diabetes had been in existence for long, the role of pancreas in the disease was not known until 1889. The discovery of insulin in 1921-22 was a path-breaking event in the treatment of diabetes, particularly Type 1. In fact, before insulin was discovered, Type 1 diabetes was considered as fatal.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><br \/>\n<img class=\"wp-image-11442 img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/insulin-Diabetes.co_.uk_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><em>Image Courtesy: Diabetes.co.uk<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Insulin plays a major role in helping cells to convert sugar obtained from food into energy. Insulin as a medicine was discovered by Dr. Fredrick Banting at the University of Toronto. It was first administered on a young boy who was dying at a hospital in Toronto, and insulin saved his life.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-11443 img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Edward_Albert_Sharpey-Schafer_Wikimedia-Commons.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><em>Image Courtesy: Wikimedia Commons<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The name insulin was coined by Sir Edward Albert Sharpey.

It is not an insular disease, restricted to any particular organ. It is called \u201csugar\u201d in daily conversations to denote elevated levels of sugar in the blood of diabetics. This elevated sugar impacts the normal functioning of the body in various ways.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-11430 img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Darkening-of-Neck-The-Fit-Indian.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><em>Image Courtesy: The Fit Indian<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unutilized extra insulin circulating in the blood can harm the skin, because it can sometimes trigger skin cells to reproduce themselves rapidly. The resultant skin cells have more melanin, a pigment which can make the skin dark. This can lead to dark patches in certain parts of the skin. And it\u2019s for this reason that dark and velvety patches in the underarms, the groin and the neck are indicators of diabetes.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-11431 img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Human-brain-Kanigas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><em>Image Courtesy: Kanigas<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unutilized extra insulin also starts affecting the brain by tempering with its chemistry. It leads to formation of toxic proteins that can poison brain cells. Incidentally, these same proteins are a cause of Alzheimer\u2019s. While most diabetics focus on their diet and weight to control their diabetes, they remain totally unmindful of the impending harm to their brain. These challenges come to the fore only when diabetes turns into full blown Alzheimer\u2019s disease.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone img-responsive wp-image-11432\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Yeast.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><\/p>\n<p>Excessive glucose attracts yeast, which is the reason why diabetes comes with a host of fungal infections.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone img-responsive wp-image-11438\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Arteries.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><\/p>\n<p>Elevated glucose also affects the circulatory system of the body leading to hardening of arteries, delayed wound healing and tingling in nerves.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-11433 img-responsive\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/eye-color-blue-z-c-660x440-All-about-Vision.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><em>Image Courtesy: All about Vision<\/em><\/p>\n<p>An elevated blood sugar can also affect eye health.

They continue to lose weight even after sufficient intake of food. Typically, the sugar obtained from food gets converted into energy with the help of insulin. However, that doesn\u2019t happen in diabetes, because the patients either have inadequate insulin or are suffering from insulin resistance. As a result, the brain starts using muscle and fat for energy, leading to weight loss.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone img-responsive wp-image-11436\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/cinnamon-1971496_960_720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\"><\/p>\n<p>Cinnamon is considered to be beneficial for diabetes as it activates enzymes that help absorb insulin.
