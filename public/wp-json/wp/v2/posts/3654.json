Nutritional support is critical for diabetics because diabetes \u00a0tends to drain nutrients.\u00a0When levels of glucose are high in the blood, the body tries to \u2018wash\u2019 the excess sugar out. This is why diabetics need to use the washroom frequently. Unfortunately, diabetics also lose nutrients via their urine. Research studies show that diabetics are repeatedly found to be deficient in important water-soluble vitamins and minerals. What\u2019s more, the loss of these vitamins worsens the body\u2019s ability to manage blood sugar, creating a vicious cycle. \u00a0Combining a healthy diabetes diet plan and a daily exercise routine with the best vitamin supplements for diabetics goes a long way in achieving stable blood sugar levels.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"What_Vitamins_Are_Diabetics_Deficient_In\"><span id=\"What_Vitamins_Are_Diabetics_Deficient_In\">What Vitamins Are Diabetics Deficient In?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The term vitamin is short for \u201cVital Amino Acid\u201d. This means that these are vital for the proper functioning of hundreds of chemical processes in the body which the body cannot manage by itself. Proper blood sugar control is one such function for which vitamins are critical. There are 13 essential vitamins that the human body requires and they must be obtained from an external source &#8212; through food and\/or supplements.<\/p>\n<p>Diabetics need two kinds of vitamins:<\/p>\n<p><em><u>Water Soluble<\/u><\/em> &#8211; Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, C, Biotin, and Folate are water-soluble and cannot be stored in the body for longer periods of time. Diabetics are often deficient in these vitamins since they pass greater amounts of urine daily. As their body tries to get rid of extra sugar, diabetics lose more water-soluble vitamins than most others. That\u2019s why diabetics need to to get these vitamins daily in doses larger than what normal people need. Luckily, you can get all of these in a single, high potency multivitamin, which you can take twice a day, and thus make up for most of the vitamins lost.<\/p>\n<p><em><u>Fat Soluble<\/u><\/em> &#8211; Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble, which is yet another reason why we \u00a0highly recommend a Low Carb-High Fat (LCHF) diet for diabetics. If you eat a diet that is high in good fats, the fat soluble vitamins can be stored in the body for longer periods of time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/8-top-research-backed-diabetes-superfoods\/\">8 Top Research-Backed Diabetes Superfoods<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Do_The_13_Vitamins_do\">What Do The 13 Vitamins do?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at all 13 essential vitamins and then figure out the best vitamins for diabetes type 2.

Multivitamin:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Taking a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement everyday dramatically reduces infections and sick days in diabetics.<\/p>\n<p>According to a study published in American Journal of Epidemiology in 2001, men who took multivitamins had reduced risk of diabetes. Women too benefited, though the gains were marginally lower.<\/p>\n<p>If you prefer to take a high potency multivitamin, you may not need to take individual vitamins separately. However, if you have specific problems that are better addressed by such vitamins or if you have deficiency of a vitamin like vitamin D3, you may want to dose these individually.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Vitamin B3:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Researchers from University of Iowa have discovered that Niacin, or Vitamin B3, helped lower blood sugar, reduce fatty liver and also prevent neuropathy in mice with diabetes type 2. The lead authors of the study conducted in May 2016 proved that Niacin protected the pre-diabetic and diabetic mice against nerve damage and helped maintain their normal sensitivity to heat. These findings provide a scientific rationale for conducting human trials to test the effects of Vitamin B3 on metabolic disorders including prediabetes and T2D, as well as obesity, fatty liver disease and neuropathies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Vitamin B6 and B12<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted at 5 university medical centers in Canada between May 2001 and July 2007. 238 diabetic participants who received B-vitamin therapy had reduced kidney damage caused by diabetes. Their arterial health improved too. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/diabetic-nephropathy-kidney-disease\/\">Diabetics with kidney issues<\/a> are often found to have too much of the harmful chemical homocystiene in their blood. B-vitamin therapy &#8211; with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 have been shown to lower the blood levels of homocysteine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Vitamin C<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to a report published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, diabetes mellitus may lower serum vitamin C concentrations in the blood. Data obtained from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u20131994) showed that mean blood Vitamin C concentrations were significantly lower in persons with newly diagnosed diabetes than in those without diabetes. Another NCBI study found that Vitamin C improves widening of arteries to allow suffient blood flow in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Vitamin D<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Published in Endocrine Society, a report concluded that insufficiency of Vitamin D and calcium may negatively influence blood sugar control. It was also found that combined supplementation of both nutrients may be beneficial <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/14-amazing-herbs-that-lower-blood-sugar\/\">to control blood sugar<\/a>. Another Spanish study ascertained that Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to alter insulin synthesis and secretion. Insulin is responsible for escorting sugar into the cells and removing it from the blood.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Vitamin E<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An Italian study published in American Diabetes Association journal Diabetes Care showed that Vitamin E administration could reduce protein glycosylation in diabetic subjects.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"When_to_Have_Vitamins\">When to Have Vitamins?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The best time to have your vitamins would be with your food. This allows for the nutrients to be absorbed far more easily into the body. Ideally, your vitamins should be split into even doses\u00a0across the day &#8211; morning and night.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Beyond_Vitamins_What_Else_Can_Help_Manage_Diabetics\"><span id=\"Beyond_Vitamins_What_Else_Can_Help_Manage_Diabetics\">Beyond Vitamins: What Else Can Help Manage Diabetics?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Besides the above mentioned best vitamins for Type 2 diabetics, it\u2019s important to note that other supplements like Magnesium, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/chromium-for-diabetes-type-2\/\">Chromium <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/omega-3-fatty-acids-types-benefits\/\">Omega 3<\/a> fatty acids are also extremely beneficial for diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>So go ahead, and give your body the natural advantage in its fight against diabetes.
