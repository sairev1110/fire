Sadly, with increased affluence and easy availability of processed foods, the fad of eating six small meals a day to stave off cravings has become popular. Eating frequent meals keeps your blood sugar and insulin levels consistently high. If you keep giving your body food, it has no incentive to burn fat.

But, simple daily dietary changes can help cut the risk factor by more than 50%. While your doctor may think that diabetes medication, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/metformin-side-effects\/\">metformin<\/a>, should be your first choice, we strongly recommend a pre-diabetes diet meal plan coupled with regular exercise as your first line of defense.<br \/>\nHowever, these 4 mistakes are best avoided while charting out your new diet plan &#8211;<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mistake_No_1_Dont_think_you_only_have_to_avoid_sugar\">Mistake No #1: Don\u2019t think you only have to avoid sugar<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s more to diabetes than just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/magnesium-and-diabetes-type-2\/\">cutting back on sugar<\/a>. The misconception that eating sugar causes diabetes is far from the truth. The real culprit is simple carbohydrates that break down into sugars upon ingestion. Inactivity and a poor metabolism also play a significant role, which is why you need to clean up all your lifestyle choices and lose weight.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mistake_No_2_Dont_blindly_pick_everything_labeled_low_fat\">Mistake No #2: Don\u2019t blindly pick everything labeled \u2018low fat\u2019<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may think that low-fat food items are okay for someone who is trying to lose weight. In our experience, fat, in general, gets a bad rep for no valid reasons. Good, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/heart\/heart-healthy-chicken-recipes\/\">heart-healthy<\/a> fats are needed by your body. To make matters worse, most low-fat food substitutes contain hidden sugars to improve their taste, which is far riskier for prediabetics.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mistake_No_3_Fats_are_not_the_villain\">Mistake No #3: Fats are not the villain<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The real villains, as we\u2019ve mentioned above, are processed carbs. We highly recommend a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/diabetes-and-weight-loss-type-2\/\">LCHF diet to lose weight<\/a>. An LCHF diet (Low Carb High Fat diet) focuses on restricting starches and sugary foods like bread and pasta, and instead, focuses on eating healthy foods, including lots of natural fats. There\u2019s no calorie counting required either. By choosing a low carb diet that encourages high fat intake and moderate protein intake, your blood glucose levels stay stable all day long. You also feel fuller on lesser food.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mistake_No_4_Dont_underestimate_the_power_of_losing_even_a_little_bit_of_weight\">Mistake No #4: Don\u2019t underestimate the power of losing even a little bit of weight<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In 2007, the American Diabetes Association published the results of a \u2018One-Year Results of the Look AHEAD Trial\u2019 to study the reduction in weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes. It showed that losing even 5-7% of your body weight reduces the risk for developing T2D by as much as 58%. You can lose weight by following a diet especially created to help burn stored abdominal fat (like the LCHF or Low-Carb-High-Fat Diet coupled with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes-questions\/type-2-diabetes-medication-fasting-intermittently\/\">Intermittent Fasting<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mistake_No5_Dont_eat_frequently\">Mistake No#5: Don\u2019t eat frequently<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ignore the fads. Give your body a break between the three main meals of the day. Let it get sensitive to insulin again. Let your body burn fat for energy between meals. No doubt, it takes a little getting used to. But, if you make sure that your diet has the good fats your body needs, it will respond by learning to use fats, instead of craving sugar.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">MORE: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/top-5-yoga-asanas-for-diabetes\/\">Top 5 Yoga Exercises For Diabetes<\/a><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"Pre-Diabetes_Recipes\"><span id=\"Pre-Diabetes_Recipes\">Pre-Diabetes Recipes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Change can be hard.
