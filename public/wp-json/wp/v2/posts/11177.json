The therapy is gaining prominence globally as a simple but effective way to boost the immune system.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cold_Showers_BoostnbspImmunity\">Cold Showers Boost&nbsp;Immunity<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Experts suggest that the exposure to cold water works on various systems of the body, thereby helping boost the overall immunity. It causes the lymphatic circulation to increase, which flushes out the toxins from the body. It also improves the cardiovascular health by stimulating the blood flow, thereby improving heart health.<\/p>\n<p>When the cold water touches the skin, the nerve endings are said to activate the endorphins in the brain, which stimulates the immune system. A study conducted in 2007 estimated that brief cold water stress repeated daily over several months can enhance anti-tumor immunity of the body.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cold_Showers_Reduce_Muscular_Inflammation\">Cold Showers Reduce Muscular Inflammation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Studies suggest that cold water immersion prevents muscle soreness and helps the muscles recover faster after exercise. High-intensity sports athletes are looking at cold water therapy for physical rehabilitation and relief from muscular pain. Cold water therapy triggers the release of the anti-inflammatory norepinephrine, which reduces short-term pain from injuries.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cold_Showers_Can_Boost_Happiness\">Cold Showers Can Boost Happiness<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Studies conclude that cold showers can be a potential treatment for depression. Cold water therapy is said to boost happiness by releasing mood-boosting neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine.<\/p>\n<p>Other benefits of cold water therapy include increased metabolism, increased antioxidant content, which improves functioning of the liver, and increased tolerance of the&nbsp;body to stress.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to get started with cold water therapy is to start slowly. One of the ways to get started is by following the usual hot shower with a cold one for not more than thirty seconds. The feet, hands and the face should be first introduced to the cold water, and later on, the whole body.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Practiced for centuries in Asian countries like India, this therapy works on the basis that body gains vitality and resilience, and increases its immune power, through controlled stress caused by the cold water. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":19473,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[66],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>3 Amazing Science-Backed Benefits of Cold Showers | Sepalika<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Cold showers come with numerous benefits, such as boosting of immunity, reduced muscular inflammation and boosting happiness.\" \/>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/immunity\/cold-showers-benefits\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"3 Science-Backed Benefits of Cold Showers\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"A cold shower can boost your health!
