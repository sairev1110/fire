which the study theorized was due to insulin re-sensitization.<\/p>\n<p>In the study, free testosterone levels were reduced, as were cholesterol levels, blood pressure and LH\/FSH ratio was improved.\u00a0 In addition, all of the women lost a significant amount of weight over the 6 months of the study.\u00a0 Last but not least, 2 of the 5 women that were previously infertile conceived after the study!<\/p>\n<p>The ketogenic diet is also well known at reducing chronic inflammation.\u00a0 It does this through several mechanisms in the body, including reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), limiting sugar (which causes inflammation in the stomach) and increasing ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) which help block inflammation.<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">[iv]<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Modifying_Keto_for_PCOS\">Modifying Keto for PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20914\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Modifying-Keto-for-PCOS.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20914\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20914\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Modifying-Keto-for-PCOS.webp\" alt=\"Ketogenic Diet work for PCOS\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Modifying Keto for PCOS<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The first step to properly starting a ketogenic diet is to calculate the macronutrients (fat, carbohydrates, protein, calories) needed for the diet that are specific to your body.\u00a0 There are many calculator tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ketodomain.com\/keto-calculator\/\">this one<\/a> available that consider personal attributes such as body weight, sex, height, and health factors.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, because a ketogenic diet is low carbohydrate, many people do not consume enough fiber (since fiber usually comes from carbohydrates).\u00a0 However, this does not have to be the case.\u00a0 There are many options of low carbohydrate vegetables that should be incorporated on a diet that will give a person enough fiber throughout the day.\u00a0 Plus, avocados, a mainstay for keto, have about 13 grams of fiber &#8211; over half of the recommended amount for a 2000 calorie diet.<\/p>\n<p>Vitamins and supplements are also an important factor to include on a ketogenic diet.\u00a0 Many people fall short on potassium, calcium and magnesium.\u00a0 While potassium needs to be obtained from food, calcium and magnesium can come from supplements or food.\u00a0 Cheese and almonds are two foods that can be incorporated into a ketogenic diet to provide calcium and magnesium; while avocados and salmon provide a good amount of potassium.<\/p>\n<p>Drinking plenty of water and supplementing with sodium is also important.\u00a0 One of the side effects of a ketogenic diet is water loss due to glycogen depletion.\u00a0 This can cause the body to also deplete sodium.\u00a0 Drinking plenty of water and adding sodium to food is an easy and simple solution to this possible side effect.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Downsides_of_Keto_for_PCOS\">The Downsides of Keto for PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_20915\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Downsides-of-Keto-for-PCOS.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20915\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20915\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/The-Downsides-of-Keto-for-PCOS.webp\" alt=\"Ketogenic Diet work for PCOS\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20915\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Downsides of Keto for PCOS<\/p><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"Possible_Weight_Gain\">Possible Weight Gain<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While a ketogenic diet is often used for weight loss, if macronutrients and calories are not properly tracked, it can easily cause weight gain.\u00a0 How you ask?\u00a0\u00a0 Because fat is extremely calorie dense compared to carbohydrates.\u00a0 In only 1 tablespoon of butter is about 100 calories.\u00a0 If you compared this to 1 tablespoon of any carbohydrate, it would a fraction of those calories.\u00a0 Tracking meals and being aware of portion sizes is extremely important when starting a ketogenic diet.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of this, a ketogenic diet is actually super helpful for weight loss.\u00a0 It improves satiety and fullness hormones, while reducing hunger hormones.\u00a0 It also improves fat utilization for energy, while decreasing fat storage.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Menstruation_Irregularity\">Menstruation Irregularity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Drastically reducing carbohydrates can lead to period irregularity in some women.\u00a0 Some women actually do need a certain amount of carbohydrates for menstruation, but the difficulty is that this amount is different for every person.\u00a0 Some women may menstruate perfectly normal on the keto diet, while others may not at all.\u00a0 If a person if very active, they may require more carbohydrates than someone who is not active.\u00a0 You must be aware of your body and the changes incurred from a ketogenic diet.\u00a0 Speaking to a nutritionist who is familiar with the ketogenic diet is highly recommended prior to beginning.<\/p>\n<p>One option for very active women is carb cycling or a cyclical ketogenic diet.\u00a0 Both of these involve the reintroduction of carbohydrates periodically, while the majority of the time sticking to a ketogenic diet.<\/p>\n<p>On a cyclical ketogenic diet, carbs can be increased one or two days a week around high times of exercise.<\/p>\n<p>For carb cycling, it is just the reintroduction of carbs a few days a week to a few days a month, not around times of exercise.<\/p>\n<p>Again, speaking to a nutritionist familiar with keto is the best way to figure out what your body can handle, especially if your period becomes irregular after starting keto.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While more studies are needed to continue to prove the results of a ketogenic diet on PCOS, the initial studies are very encouraging.\u00a0 Proper implementation is a necessity when starting the diet.\u00a0 Speaking to a nutritionist and your physician is recommended prior to starting the diet.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
