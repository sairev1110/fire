You can use a vaporizer or humidifier to diffuse a few drops of the essential oil so the scent fills up the room. You can also open the bottle and directly inhale the scent. Or you can apply a few drops to your pillow so you inhale the scent all night long.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Apply_On_Skin\">Apply On Skin<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Topical application of essential oils requires care. It\u2019s best to never apply any essential oil directly on to skin, unless told otherwise, as these are very potent and can cause interactions. It\u2019s good to blend essential oils with carrier oil like castor oil or coconut oil. A massage with essential oils is extremely beneficial for PCOS related cramps, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-bloating\/\">bloating <\/a>and pain. Because massage helps in improving blood circulation to the affected area, and the oil is readily absorbed in the area.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ingest_Them\">Ingest Them<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Very few essential oils can be safely ingested, which is why it\u2019s best to work with a naturopath or a natural healthcare practitioner who is trained in aromatherapy. When essential oils for PCOS are safe for ingestion, you can add a few drops into a cup of herbal tea and sip slowly.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that not all essential oils for PCOS are created equal. To find relief from PCOS symptoms, it\u2019s imperative that you choose the highest quality essential oils that are made from\u00a0pesticide-free plants. It\u2019s best to do a bit of research or ask for professional advice to help\u00a0find a good, reputable brand.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While lifestyle changes certainly help in managing the symptoms of PCOD, reversing the condition requires a holistic approach.
