Then a sneeze comes on, your eyes and throat start itching wildly, and you know they\u2019re here\u2026 the dreaded spring allergies!<\/p>\n<p>You start popping Zyrtec, Claritin, Allegra, or Benadryl, eye drops, nasal sprays\u2014whatever you need to do to control your annoying symptoms. But you\u2019re tired and groggy from all the meds and from the constant allergen assault on your immune system. You might start to wonder, is there a better way to deal with seasonal allergies? We hope so!<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at why allergies, including spring and seasonal allergies happen in the first place to see if there\u2019s an opportunity for us to intervene and help make our symptoms\u2014and our lives\u2014a little more comfortable.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Causes_Allergies\">What Causes Allergies?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Allergies stem from a weak yet over-active immune system. It\u2019s true that our immune system is our defense system, but it isn\u2019t supposed to be launching an attack against the foods we eat and the world we live in\u2014we shouldn\u2019t be allergic to life!<\/p>\n<p>When the immune system is strong, it launches appropriate attacks only when necessary. According to John Hopkins Medicine, its purpose is to defend and protect us against genuinely dangerous and foreign substances like certain bacteria, fungi, and viruses. If an infectious agent does get into the body, the immune system\u2019s job is to attack and destroy it before it wreaks havoc on our system.<\/p>\n<p>But when our immune system is weak, it starts to malfunction and recognize innocuous substances (e.g., pollen, dander, food) as a threat. Obviously this is not ideal. The goal is to balance the immune system\u2014not weaken or strengthen it\u2014so that it functions as it should in each given situation.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Drugs_Are_Not_The_Cure\">The Drugs Are Not The Cure<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Antihistamines like Benaryl, Zyrtec, Claritin and others are the most common drugs used for seasonal allergies. They work by blocking or opposing the activity of histamine receptors in the body, masking the symptoms (until it\u2019s time for another dose) but doing nothing to help heal the condition itself. In fact, these so-called \u201caids\u201d may even push the body further into dysfunction, weakening your immune system more so that the next time we\u2019re exposed to that allergen, our system reacts even more poorly.<\/p>\n<p>Why are the allergic reactions happening in the first place? Why is the immune system weak and over-zealous? These are questions we need to examine for ourselves to attack the problem at its source. The answers may be different for each person, but highlighting some common patterns among those who suffer from allergies may shine the light on some good places to start to bring the body into better balance.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dont_Ignore_The_Gut\">Don\u2019t Ignore The Gut<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Our digestive tract is home to 70\u201380% of our immune tissue, so this is an area not to be ignored. Home to trillions of bacterial cells, researchers have discovered that it\u2019s a <em>lack<\/em> of diversity in gut bacteria that can be a driving force in developing allergies. Having enough healthy bacteria is essential for a strong immune system.<\/p>\n<p>And when you consider the unhealthy foods we eat, as well as the unavoidable stress, the GMOs damaging our intestinal walls, and all the pesticides and toxins we constantly come into contact with, it\u2019s no wonder our immunity is taking a big hit!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Healthy_Bacteria\">Healthy Bacteria<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18462\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18462\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18462\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Probiotics-and-Diabetes-Yogurt.webp\" alt=\"natural remedies for seasonal allergies - don't ignore healthy bacteria\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-18462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">natural remedies for seasonal allergies &#8211; don&#8217;t ignore healthy bacteria<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Clearly, probiotics would be of good use here to increase healthy bacteria in the digestive tract to boost immunity and ward off the not-so-nice pathogenic bacteria. Look for a high-quality probiotic that ideally has more than just 1 or 2 strains, as more strains may be better to attain more diversity of bacteria. But find what works for you\u2014we\u2019re all different, and some may do better with a couple specific strands instead of many.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What seems to work for many: 1\u20132 probiotic capsules per day,\u00a0preferably one with several different strains. Follow instructions on the bottle or talk to a healthcare provider for specific instructions for that product\u2014some strains, like saccharomyces boulardii (great for allergies and yeast overgrowth), work better on an empty stomach, whereas others are best after a meal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Traditional fermented foods like sauerkraut or pickles are another way to get natural probiotics without having to take a pill. But all pickles are not created equal! It\u2019s important that the foods are found in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. If they\u2019re not refrigerated or have vinegar listed as an ingredient (to mimic the taste of natural fermentation), then it\u2019s not truly fermented! The fermentation process is what yields all the great probiotic strains your gut and immune system need, so don\u2019t be fooled by those imitators.<\/p>\n<p>If high quality, yogurt can be great too. But make sure you find one that says it contains live cultures, and search for one without added sugar (including artificial sweeteners!) or junky, unnecessary ingredients. Look for full-fat dairy too\u2014as fat, 1 of the 3 main macronutrients we need in our diets, is necessary for proper digestion and assimilation of nutrients. And it will keep you satiated and satisfied for longer so that you\u2019re not reaching for a snack an hour or two later.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What seems to work for many: Fermented vegetable products can be strong if you\u2019re not used to them, so try a small amount at first\u2014maybe 1 tsp or so, and work your way up from there. As your gut bacteria balances back out, taking too much at once can be too much for your system! Low and slow is the way to go with probiotics and fermented foods until you know how your system will respond. Yogurt isn\u2019t as strong, so the serving size is less important. Aim for a serving daily of yogurt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once we realize that seasonal allergies stem from a weak immune system, as well as one that is a hyper-reactive and over-zealous, we can look at things to help strengthen and boost our defense system, as well as things to calm it down so it will quit misfiring against anything and everything.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Spring_Allergies_Tip_1_Exercise_For_The_Win\">Spring Allergies Tip # 1: Exercise For The Win<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18463\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18463\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18463\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Exercise-and-diabetes.webp\" alt=\"natural remedies for seasonal allergies - exercise\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-18463\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">natural remedies for seasonal allergies &#8211; exercise<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Exercise strengthens the immune system, so that\u2019s a good place to start. If being outside is not a good idea due to environmental allergens, then stick to working out in a gym or indoors with the windows closed to keep allergens out.

Stress damages the intestinal wall, where 70\u201380% of our immune system lives. It also clogs up the lymphatic drainage system, resulting in a buildup of undesirable toxins and system-wide inflammation. Along with strengthening the immune system, exercise can also help with stress management.<\/p>\n<p>Other tools to help with stress include yoga, meditation, mindfulness, counseling, and more. It really can be as simple as: what do you enjoy doing? Go do that! When we\u2019re engaged in something that is genuinely enjoyable to us, like painting, walking, reading, or talking with a friend, we turn off the stress, which is nothing but good news. <em>What seems to work for many: Try to spend at least 30 minutes per day doing something enjoyable or relaxing.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Spring_Allergies_Tip_3_Adapt_to_Stress_Using_Adaptogens\">Spring Allergies Tip #3: Adapt to Stress Using Adaptogens<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18465\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18465\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18465\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Gerd-TCM.jpg\" alt=\"natural remedies for seasonal allergies \" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-18465\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">natural remedies for seasonal allergies<\/p><\/div>\n<p>But sometimes no matter what we do, the stress seems to win.
