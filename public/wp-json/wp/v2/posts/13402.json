Hence the treatment often does more harm than good in the long run. Many drugs also worsen gastritis.\u00a0On the other hand, essential oils are all-natural plant extracts. They rarely have any harmful side-effects, especially when correct dosage is given.<\/p>\n<p>Steam distallation is used to extract essential oils from different parts of plants. These oils are highly concentrated, making them extra-potent. So, why should you choose essential oils to treat stomach ulcers over allopathic treatments?\u00a0We\u2019ll give you 6 good reasons.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"6_Reasons_To_Use_Essential_Oils_For_Treating_Stomach_Ulcers\"><strong>6 Reasons To Use Essential Oils For Treating Stomach Ulcers:<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>They promote a healthy balance\u00a0of bacteria. Our gut is home to over 100 trillion\u00a0bacteria. These bacteria help us break down the food we eat and absorb nutrition from it. They help in defending against germs and infection too. Antibiotics kill all bacteria \u2013 both good and bad. On the other hand, essential oils only target the bad bacteria causing peptic ulcers. This promotes a healthy balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut.<\/li>\n<li>They are an all natural treatment. They can soothe the pain and discomfort of stomach ulcers, without side effects.<\/li>\n<li>They also have a soothing, anti-inflammatory effect on stomach ulcers.<\/li>\n<li>Essential oils are gentle digestive aids that don\u2019t disrupt digestive enzymes.<\/li>\n<li>They also encourage effective digestion, reducing bloating, gastritis and flatulence.<\/li>\n<li>They mildly suppress stomach acid production, which helps those suffering from hyperacidity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span id=\"5_Best_Essential_Oils_For_Stomach_Ulcers\">5 Best Essential Oils For Stomach Ulcers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Scientists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC201172\/\">at Nestle Research Center, Switzerland<\/a>\u00a0have done a detailed study on essential oils for stomach ulcers.

Carrot Seed Oil lessens the effects of pylori\u00a0bacteria in the stomach. This bacteria causes ulcers and other upsets.<\/li>\n<li>As a strong flatulence-reliever, Carrot Seed Oil helps release trapped gases from the intestines. This helps relieve flatulence, bloating and other gastric distress.<\/li>\n<li>It stimulates the secretion of digestive enzymes, gastric juices, and bile. It makes motility of the intestines more effective too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Keep in mind<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carrot Seed Oil is not suited for those who have epilepsy. Because it can potentially trigger overstimulation.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s also not safe for use during pregnancy.<\/li>\n<li>Topical use of carrot seed oil increases skin sensitivity. Choose to apply it at night, or stay indoors after application. It\u2019s also recommended to keep skin covered for 72 hours post application.<\/li>\n<li>Never apply pure carrot seed essential oil to skin without mixing into carrier oil.
