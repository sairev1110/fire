If heartburn is keeping you up at night, it\u2019s time to take some action. The best thing you can do &#8212; arm yourself with the right knowledge to keep <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/symptoms-of-acid-reflux\/\">acid reflux symptoms <\/a>at bay and get a restful night\u2019s sleep.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_Does_Your_Heartburn_Get_Worse_At_Night\">Why Does Your Heartburn Get Worse At Night?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>One word answer \u2013<strong> Gravity<\/strong>. Gravity keeps gastric acid in the stomach while you\u2019re standing or sitting. But when you are lying down, it is easier for gastric acid and other stomach contents to rise back up the esophagus, causing heartburn.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, while we are sleeping, the mouth produces less saliva and rate of swallowing also goes down. This, in turn, hinders with esophageal pH levels to return back to normal after the acid has traveled back up the esophagus. The result \u2013 you wake up choking and coughing with a sore throat.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0002927003003605\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research<\/a> has shown that night time heartburn occurs in a large majority of adults with GERD, resulting in sleeping difficulties and impaired next-day function. It\u2019s important to understand that GERD and sleep have a bi-directional relationship. Acid Reflux adversely affects sleep quality by waking you up at night. At the same time, sleep deprivation can adversely affect heartburn severity by enhancing the perception of acid in the esophagus causing esophageal hypersensitivity, and potentially by increasing esophageal acid exposure time. If you have acid reflux, lack of sleep puts your body into stress, which increases the discomfort associated with increased acidity.<\/p>\n<p>So, what can be done to prevent heartburn from keeping you up at night?<!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19536\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Natural-Ways-To-Avoid-Heartburn.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19536\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19536\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Natural-Ways-To-Avoid-Heartburn.webp\" alt=\"16 Natural Ways To Avoid Heartburn At Night\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19536\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">16 Natural Ways To Avoid Heartburn At Night<\/p><\/div>\n<p>We have put together a list of things to avoid at night with heartburn so you can improve your sleep. Remember, when it comes to heartburn, lifestyle and behavior modifications can go a long way toward helping you get a restful night\u2019s sleep.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"1_Dont_Have_Fruit_For_Dessert\">1. Don\u2019t Have Fruit For Dessert<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may think that a piece of fruit may be a safer way to end a delicious meal, but you would be wrong. Fruit is best eaten before your meal. Eating fruit after dinner may exacerbate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/symptoms-of-acid-reflux\/\">acid reflux symptoms<\/a> as it will tend to ferment in the stomach while waiting for rest of food to digest.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Dont_Drink_Water_Right_After_Dinner\">\u00a02. Don\u2019t Drink Water Right After Dinner<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Water dilutes stomach acids essential for digestion. Avoid drinking water after a meal. In fact, it\u2019s best to drink a glass of water 30 minutes before a meal to flush out all old gastric juices from the digestive tract, which will aid in fresh, concentrated acid production. This acid will get to work digesting your dinner immediately after eating and is best not diluted with excess water. Wait for 30 to 45 minutes to have water post dinner.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/home-remedies-heartburn\/\">14 Effective Home Remedies For Heartburn<\/a><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Dont_Eat_Too_Fast\">3. Don\u2019t Eat Too Fast<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Digestion begins in the mouth, as saliva contains digestive enzymes that help breakdown food. When you chew your food properly, your stomach has to work less hard to digest the food. Did you know that it takes 20 minutes for the brain to realize you\u2019re full? Eating slow gives the stomach enough time to signal to the brain that you\u2019re satiated, preventing overeating. Challenge yourself to make each meal last up to 30 minutes. Use a timer if necessary!<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"4_Say_No_To_Mint\">4. Say No To Mint<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Peppermint can help freshen up your breath after eating, but it can also trigger heartburn. Avoid peppermint infused foods, beverages, desserts, candy, or mouth fresheners as these can relax the LES or the lower esophageal sphincter that works as a lid between the esophagus and the stomach to keep stomach contents from coming back up the esophagus.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"5_Avoid_Late_Dinners\">5. Avoid Late Dinners<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>To prevent night time heartburn, eat an early dinner. This gives your body ample time to be able to digest the food before its time to sleep. Make sure there\u2019s a gap of 2 to 3 hours between dinner time and bed time.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"6_An_Erratic_Sleep_Routine_Is_Doing_You_No_Good\">6. An Erratic Sleep Routine Is Doing You No Good<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Train your body to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. A healthy sleep routine ensures a restful night\u2019s sleep, especially when you have eaten two to three hours before bedtime. Have a warm bath, practice deep breathing and keep your room cool to help you drift off to sleep more easily.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"7_Dont_Lie_Down_After_Your_Meal\">7. Don\u2019t Lie Down After Your Meal<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Like watching TV to kill time between dinner and going to bed? Make sure you watch TV sitting upright! Posture plays a big role in acid reflux. Sprawling on the couch to catch up on your favorite shows is just as bad at trying to sleep immediately after dinner, as it will make it easier for the stomach acid and food to rise back up the esophagus. Sit up, so that gravity can keep stomach contents where they belong.<!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"8_A_Heavy_Dinner_Is_A_Mistake\">8. A Heavy Dinner Is A Mistake<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper. Overeating is a sure fire way to exacerbate heartburn symptoms, as eating too much too soon puts extra stress on the digestive system. Ease heartburn symptoms by further making that smaller dinner low in fat, because fats are harder to digest. A light meal is easily digested by the body and will also help you lose weight.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/sleeping-pills-and-acid-reflux\/\">Sleeping Pills Worsen Acid Reflux! Try Natural Substitutes<\/a><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"9_Avoid_Trigger_Foods_at_Dinner_Time\">9. Avoid Trigger Foods at Dinner Time<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>We all have some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/acid-reflux\/ten-foods-avoid-acid-reflux\/\">GERD food trigger<\/a>, and these are best avoided at dinner time. For some this may be spicy foods and citrusy foods, and for others it could be dairy, fried foods, sodas, and chocolates. Be mindful of your heartburn triggers and avoid them at dinner time at all costs. Also, choose your cheese wisely. Hard cheeses like Parmesan or Swiss are easier on reflux than soft ones like Feta and Brie. Pizza and Chinese takeout is also best avoided for dinner.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"10_Avoid_Late_Night_Snacking\">10. Avoid Late Night Snacking<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Eating a snack too close to bedtime can trigger heartburn symptoms. If you do get hungry post dinner, eat a light snack and delay bedtime. Read a book or walk around your home for a while, so that the snack is digested before you hit the bed.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"11_Keep_Stress_At_Bay\">11. Keep Stress At Bay<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You probably already know that stress and GERD are intricately linked. But did you know stress comes in many forms? It\u2019s not enough to just keep work stress at bay; you also want to avoid emotional stress before bedtime. Don\u2019t get into an argument with your partner or kids at night; somethings are best done in the morning. Also, avoid watching high action movies, a gory TV show or reading stressful new material before bedtime; it will make it harder for your mind to shut down and go to sleep.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"12_Say_No_To_After_Dinner_Coffees\">12. Say No To After Dinner Coffees<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Coffee can relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which prevents the backward flow of stomach contents that causes reflux. Have decaf coffee, or better yet, choose an herbal tea at the end of your meal.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/alcohol-and-acid-reflux\/\">Does Alcohol Worsen Acid Reflux?<\/a><\/div>\n<h3><span id=\"13_Dont_Wear_Fitted_Sleepwear\">13. Don\u2019t Wear Fitted Sleepwear<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Sleepwear that is so tight it cuts into your skin is not only uncomfortable; it will also worsen night time acid reflux. A tight waistband exerts pressure on to your stomach and on the lower esophageal sphincter. Pick comfy pajamas that are light weight and loose fitting instead.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"14_Raise_the_Head_Of_Your_Bed\">14. Raise the Head Of Your Bed<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If night time reflux has been keeping you up at night, elevating your headboard can be an easy way to keep stomach acid where it belongs. When your head is raised high, stomach acid can\u2019t flow back up into the esophagus. If it\u2019s not possible to raise the headboard, try sleeping propped up on a wedge pillow for the same effect. Choose a pillow with a 6 to 8 inch incline that supports your head and neck comfortably.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"15_Dont_Sleep_On_Your_Stomach\">15. Don\u2019t Sleep On Your Stomach<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>For the same reason that we recommend you raise the head of your bed, we also advice that you don\u2019t sleep on your stomach. Also, this sleeping position exerts extra pressure on the stomach which can relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), causing stomach acid to rise up the esophagus.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"16_Avoid_Sleeping_On_Your_Right_Side\">16. Avoid Sleeping On Your Right Side<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While scientists are not exactly sure why, it\u2019s better to sleep on your left side. Some studies show that sleeping on the left reduces incidences of reflux. Experts believe sleeping on the right increases transient LES relaxations which are associated with reflux. Use pillows to prop yourself on to the left side and enjoy a restful night\u2019s sleep.<\/p>\n<p>Improve your quality of sleep with these simple tips, and save yourself from all the discomfort that comes from the dual problems of heartburn and sleeplessness.
