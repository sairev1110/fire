After all, it\u2019s critical for 300 different body processes\u00a0and is a natural anti-inflammatory.\u00a0But what is the connection between magnesium and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)? A very important one, indeed! And sadly, women with PCOS could easily become magnesium deficient, thus worsening their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-symptoms\/\">PCOS symptoms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Magnesium_And_PCOS_Benefits_Of_This_Nutrient\">Magnesium And PCOS: Benefits Of This Nutrient<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Magnesium can help a variety of PCOS symptoms. From controlling blood sugar to improving sleep and boosting energy, this essential mineral is particularly critical for PCOS patients.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"It_Improves_Insulin_Sensitivity\">It Improves Insulin Sensitivity<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21696337\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research<\/a> has shown that women with magnesium deficiency are at 19 times higher risk of PCOS than those with normal magnesium levels. PCOS patients with insulin resistance can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23322284\">exhibit significantly lower serum levels of magnesium<\/a>, further linking magnesium and PCOS. Insulin and blood sugar balance is critical to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/reverse-pcos-diet-exercise\/\">reversing PCOS<\/a>. The good news is that magnesium can enhance the secretion of insulin, thus facilitating sugar metabolism.\u00a0According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/5\/10\/3910\">trial studies<\/a>, increasing dietary magnesium intake can improve insulin resistance.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"It_Helps_Fight_Fatigue_Stress\">It Helps Fight Fatigue &amp; Stress<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Always tired? You may be magnesium deficient. Magnesium is critical for the functioning of the nervous system and adrenal glands. Magnesium deficiency contributes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-fatigue\/\">fatigue <\/a>and mood disorders. Low levels of magnesium are linked to exaggerated stress response as well as depression. Magnesium regulates cortisol levels to calm your nervous system and prevent excessive cortisol. Cortisol is our stress hormone; excessive levels of cortisol are not good for you health.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Its_Crucial_For_Heart_Health\">It\u2019s Crucial For Heart Health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You probably already know that PCOS increases your risk of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-heart-disease\/\">heart disease<\/a>. By improving insulin resistance and stress response, magnesium improves your heart health. Additionally, magnesium helps relax all muscles; remember, the human heart is also essentially a muscle. Adequate magnesium levels also help prevent the deposition of calcium in the inner walls of blood vessels, preventing hardening of arteries.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"It_Has_Natural_Anti-Inflammatory_Properties\">It Has Natural Anti-Inflammatory Properties<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Magnesium is nature\u2019s very own anti-inflammatory mineral. Since PCOS is linked to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, a magnesium supplement is great for PCOS management.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"It_Helps_Control_Weight\">It Helps Control Weight<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Magnesium is required for both proper glucose utilization and insulin signalling. Without adequate magnesium, insulin and glucose levels are elevated. Excess glucose gets stored as fat, contributing to belly fat. A magnesium supplement helps improve blood sugar control, stress response and low-grade inflammation, which is why it can also aid in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-weight-loss-tips\/\">PCOS weight loss.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"It_Promotes_Good_Sleep\">It Promotes Good Sleep<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>For PCOS patients, sleep is crucial for blood sugar control, mood disturbance, energy levels, weight control, and hormonal balance. A magnesium supplement before bedtime is a natural cure for insomnia.\u00a0 It\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27933574\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">activates the parasympathetic nervous system<\/a>, thus helping you relax and drift off to sleep. Additionally, magnesium is crucial for the production and regulation of melatonin \u2013 the natural sleep hormone of your body.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"It_Keeps_Blood_Pressure_In_Check\">It Keeps Blood Pressure In Check<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>PCOS patients are at an increased risk of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-high-blood-pressure\/\">high blood pressure<\/a>. Insufficient magnesium levels in the body can cause blood vessels to spasm, which leads to high blood pressure. Magnesium deficiency is also linked to high cholesterol levels.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Keeps_PMS_Symptoms_at_Bay\">Keeps PMS Symptoms at Bay<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you have PCOS, chances are that your periods bring with them cramping, pain, migraines, and bloat. Magnesium is a natural detoxifier, muscle relaxant, and anti-inflammatory. As a result, it helps <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3208934\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alleviate PMS symptoms<\/a> &#8212; like mood swings, irritability, depression, anxiety, bloating, fluid retention, breast tenderness, sugar cravings, headaches and poor sleep.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"It_Fights_Depression\">It Fights Depression<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>PCOS increases your risk of depression and other mood disorders. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23950577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Studies<\/a> have found a variety of neuromuscular and psychiatric symptoms, including different types of depression, can be linked to magnesium deficiency.\u00a0Magnesium is crucial for the release and uptake of serotonin &#8211; the body\u2019s natural \u2018feel-good\u2019 brain chemical. With adequate magnesium levels, your body produces sufficient serotonin, promoting emotional balance.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Causes_of_Magnesium_Deficiency\">Causes of Magnesium Deficiency<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_20577\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Mg-for-PCOS-2nd-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20577\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20577\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Mg-for-PCOS-2nd-image.webp\" alt=\"magnesium and pcos\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">magnesium and pcos<\/p><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor farming practices have led to depletion of magnesium levels in the soil<\/li>\n<li>A diet rich in processed and refined foods devoid of natural magnesium<\/li>\n<li>High levels of stress<\/li>\n<li>Insulin resistance<\/li>\n<li>Frequent alcohol intake<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/side-effects-birth-control-pills\/\">Birth control pills<\/a> (which are often prescribed for PCOS)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Since most symptoms of magnesium deficiency are very similar to PCOS symptoms, it may be a good idea to supplement with additional magnesium.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"4_Ways_To_Up_Your_Magnesium_Intake\">4 Ways To Up Your Magnesium Intake<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The current Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of Magnesium for women is between 350 and 400mg. But, experts like Dr. Mercola recommend that this figure is on the lower side, and daily intake of around 700mg might be better for PCOS patients.\u00a0Here\u2019s how you can increase your magnesium intake:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Eat_more_foods_rich_in_magnesium\">Eat more foods rich in magnesium<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>All leafy green vegetables like kale, kelp, spinach, and chard are rich in magnesium, as are nuts and seeds. Quinoa, buckwheat, and oats are other good natural sources of magnesium. Another excellent source is homemade bone broth.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Try_Magnesium_supplements\">Try Magnesium supplements<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Before you buy magnesium supplements, know that not all forms of magnesium are the same. Magnesium Glycinate\/Bisglycinate is a chelated form of magnesium that is more readily absorbed. The typical dosage is 500-1000 mg magnesium daily. Always take it with meals to facilitate absorption. I personally prefer to take magnesium supplements after dinner, as it also promotes restful sleep.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Epsom_salts_are_rich_in_magnesium\">Epsom salts are rich in magnesium<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Soaking in an Epsom salt bath facilitates the absorption of magnesium sulphate via the skin. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a bathtub. Soaking your feet in a tub of water with Epsom salts will also do the trick.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Magnesium_oil\">Magnesium oil<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Magnesium oil that comprises of magnesium chloride is another great option for topical application and absorption of magnesium via skin. This method works particularly well for those who experience tummy issues when taking magnesium supplements (magnesium citrate is often the culprit).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s always wise to discuss with your doctor before starting any magnesium supplements, oil or spray. This is especially important for those with pre-existing heart or kidney disease.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a positive experience to share about magnesium and PCOS, we would love to hear from you!<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
