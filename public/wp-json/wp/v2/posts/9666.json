They stimulate the immune system by increasing chemicals and white blood cells, which prevent infections. They also lower down the blood cholesterol levels by absorbing cholesterol from the food in the stomach and intestines.<\/p>\n<p>Some common sources of beta glucans are\u00a0mushrooms, yeast, oats and barley. In fact, medicinal mushrooms, containing them have been used in the Eastern culture for centuries to boost immunity. In Japan, they have been used as an immune system stimulant against cancer since 1980.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Increase_Immunity\">Increase Immunity<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Beta glucans are immunomodulatory compounds, which means they modulate or activate the immune system, but rarely over-stimulate it. They are known to increase the host immune defences by enhancing the natural killer cell function. Thus, they help immune cells to achieve a well-coordinated attack against pathogens and foreign bodies in the body. And this makes them an excellent\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/immunity\/immune-system-boosters\/\">immune system booster.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Can_Lower_The_Growth_of_Cancer_Cells\">Can Lower The Growth of Cancer Cells<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Beta glucans have the ability to lower the growth of the cancer cells, even while stimulating a stronger response from the immune system for protection against foreign bodies. When used along with chemotherapy, they have shown benefits in cancer patients. Research is scant but underway, to prove this in a thorough study.\u00a0A patent filed by the University Of Louisville Research Foundation claims that beta glucans, <span class=\"colour\">when used along with monoclonal antibodies,<\/span>\u00a0can help\u00a0<span class=\"colour\">in suppressing or eliminating cancer.\u00a0Monoclonal antibodies are biological drugs used for the treatment of cancer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Good_For_Lowering_Cholesterol\">Good For Lowering Cholesterol<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Beta glucans are present in oats, which has long been considered a part of the diet of heart patients. In a study conducted by the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center in Maryland, male and female participants with slightly higher cholesterol levels were given a regular dosage of oats (containing beta glucans). It was observed that their cholesterol levels reduced with regular intake of oats.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Beta glucans are naturally-occurring polysaccharides or complex carbohydrates with many benefits.
