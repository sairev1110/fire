Vaccines&nbsp;help the body in developing immunity against certain&nbsp;diseases, and doesn\u2019t seem to cause any direct harm , right? Well, we can\u2019t be so sure.<\/p>\n<p>Some vaccines could cause side effects, and therefore their usage has been a topic of controversy, lately. But, should they be avoided entirely?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with learning about what goes into a vaccine. Aside from antigens and antibiotics, they contain another ingredient called adjuvants. Adjuvants are included to enhance the response of the immune system to disease-causing agents. There are many kinds of adjuvants that are used in vaccines and are assumed to be safe. But, the truth is that they aren\u2019t. Metals and chemicals like aluminum, ethyl mercury, formaldehyde and Monosodium glutamate<em> (<\/em>MSG) are used as adjuvants, and these can be quite dangerous for the body.&nbsp;So, does administering these to children make sense?<\/p>\n<p>Chemicals such as mercury are known to be neurotoxins (toxins that affect the transfer of chemical signals between neurons).&nbsp;The most common of adjuvants is aluminum. It has been demonstrated that aluminum is a neurotoxin. Regardless of the widespread use of this adjuvant, it\u2019s surprising how medical science hasn\u2019t fully acknowledged the mechanism of this adjuvant. Research shows that it has potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. Aluminum, particularly in adjuvant form, carries risks of autoimmunity, long-term inflammation of the brain and related neurological complications.<\/p>\n<p>Including adjuvants, vaccines have many other agents like viruses and contaminants that can cause considerable injury to humans. These injuries can be anything from a swollen brain, a permanent brain injury, blood disorders, seizures and convulsions.<\/p>\n<p>Given the potential side effects of vaccines, it is important to understand them really well before using vaccines for yourself or your children. One of the ways to minimize the damage is by spacing out administration of aluminum-containing vaccines by a few months.<\/p>\n<p>The&nbsp;good news is that all of the elements mentioned above, such as aluminum or mercury, can be excreted from the body with the right diet. Probiotics, such as yogurt, can help&nbsp;in restoring the gut flora. Omega 3 oil can be another useful addition to the diet to counter the harmful effects of vaccines.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most of us have received&nbsp;vaccination at least once in our lives.
