And yet, when all this is ok, why are so many couples still struggling to conceive? As someone who has helped countless women get pregnant naturally, I will present a very different view. <br><br>I\u2019m going to begin with a short story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"No_Fruit_Look_to_Flowers_and_Branches\"><strong>No Fruit: Look to Flowers and Branches?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say you have a tree in your garden that\u2019s simply not bearing fruit. You get an expert gardener to take a look. He feels that the problem could be with pollination of the flowers. You don\u2019t have bees in your garden. So he suggests that we take pollen from the male flower and put it carefully into the female flower and then see if it leads to fertilization of the flowers and formation of fruits. You try it. It doesn\u2019t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He then suggests that maybe the problem is with the flowers themselves. Maybe they are not strong enough to bear fruit. He suggests that we should use a flower-growing spray. You do this too. But \u2013 no success.<br><br>Puzzled, he finally suggests that maybe it would be best to graft a branch from another tree, on to this one. The branch we graft will already have baby fruits on it, and when we attach it to this tree, the fruit will grow and reach full size here. Desperate, you try this as well. But sadly, the new branch is not able to join the old tree properly and the baby fruit simply withers away.<br><br>In this story till now, does something strike you as strange?<br><br>If this was happening in the real world, would you not expect the gardener to take a look at the soil first? Is the tree actually growing well in this soil? Is it getting enough water and sunlight? Does it have the nutrients and fertilizers needed for it to be healthy? All this is common sense, right?<br><br>And yet, this common sense is extremely uncommon when it comes to human infertility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Infertility_Causes_Getting_to_the_Root\">Infertility Causes: Getting to the Root<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"768\" height=\"577\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Getting-to-the-Root.webp\" alt=\"foundational health\" class=\"wp-image-20968\"\/><figcaption>Getting to the Root<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No conventional fertility expert looks at your foundations \u2013 your digestion, your sleep, your vitamin and mineral status, your stress levels, etc. Their work begins and ends at the flower and the fruit \u2013 the reproductive system. No one looks at the soil.<br><br>From follicular stimulation using Clomiphene and Letrozole, to doing follicular study and IUI, to ovarian drilling, all the way up to IVF, diagnosis and treatment is all about only the reproductive system.<br><br>But if your core health has shaky foundations, trying to fix the flower and fruit alone is unlikely to succeed. It is hardly surprising that less than 33% of IVF cycles succeed!&nbsp;That means 2 out of every 3 cycles fail!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Getting_Pregnant_Start_With_Your_Foundational_Health\">Getting Pregnant: Start With Your Foundational Health<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"759\" height=\"422\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Start-With-Your-Foundational-Health.webp\" alt=\"Start With Your Foundational Health\" class=\"wp-image-20965\"\/><figcaption>Start With Your Foundational Health<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundations of the body \u2013 the right diet, proper digestion, assimilation of nutrients, minerals, providing the right raw materials to build hormones naturally in the body, stress management and weight management \u2013 these aspects are all ignored in conventional infertility treatment, because they require time, they need expertise in nutritional and lifestyle medicine and you need the patience to stage things right.&nbsp;<br><br>To correctly identify which of these foundational aspects of health may be hampering you chances of having a baby, you need experts who are trained in nutritional sciences and in something called Functional Blood Chemistry Analysis (FBCA).<br><br>By looking at your regular blood test results differently and examining your current diet and lifestyle, these experts are able to give you insights into your health and infertility that you may not even heard of till now.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>For example:<\/strong> We\u2019ve had many women at Sepalika who were told that they have normal thyroid function, just because their lab reports showed quote-unquote Normal Values. But we could tell from their symptoms, that the thyroid needed support. We fixed it and the result was often natural pregnancy. We\u2019ve also had men who had again quote-unquote normal sperm parameters, but when we improved these further, with diet and supplementation, the couple who were infertile till then conceived naturally.<br><br>Whether it is your inability to digest protein or a waking blood cortisol level that is high or hidden insulin resistance in a thin person \u2013 we\u2019ve seen so many cases where people who were labelled infertile and subject to multiple rounds of IUI and IVF were able to conceive naturally, once their core, foundational issues were fixed.<br><br>It\u2019s common sense: the soil matters. I have a friend who runs an amazingly fertile organic farm and she tells people that she does not cultivate crops. She cultivates soil. The crop is a natural result of the fertile soil.<br><br>No doubt, follicular stimulation, IUI, IVF \u2013 all these have their place, for folks who really need them. There is absolutely no shame whatsoever in using Assisted Reproductive Techniques or ART, which are valid medical procedures.<br><br>We even partner with gynecologists&#8217; to assist couples who already know that they can\u2019t conceive naturally, because they have structural issues \u2013 like blocked fallopian tubes. We work with them to improve their chances of conception using IUI, IVF etc. Our role there too is to improve ovulation, sperm quality, etc.<br><br>But it makes sense, to first start with soil, doesn\u2019t it? I often tell patients that Nature has only two goals \u2013 Preservation and Procreation. If Nature is happy with your Foundational Health, Conception of a Baby happens naturally. And conversely, in many cases where conception is not happening naturally, it is the foundation that needs to be fixed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve worked with hundreds of clients to restore them to natural health, using this root-cause, foundational method.
