And can you still enjoy your favorite foods with reflux? Today, we\u2019ll discuss substitutes for your favorite foods that trigger acid reflux, so that you can find pleasure in food all over again!<\/p>\n<p>Today, we\u2019ll discuss substitutes for your favorite foods that trigger acid reflux, so that you can find pleasure in food all over again!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Easy-To-Digest_Grains\">Easy-To-Digest Grains<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19990\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Easy-To-Digest-Grains.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19990\" class=\"wp-image-19990 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Easy-To-Digest-Grains.webp\" alt=\"What\u2019s Good For Acid Reflux\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19990\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Easy-To-Digest Grains<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Some grains can be mildly alkaline and easier on the digestive system, like quinoa, wild rice, millet and amaranth. Others like brown rice, steel cut oats, spelt and barley are only mildly acidic and better tolerated.<\/p>\n<p>Grains like wheat, rye, corn, buckwheat and white rice are highly acidic foods. If you do want to add them to your diet, make sure that you read up on how to properly soak, sprout and ferment grains (think sourdough bread) so that the nutrients in them become more bioavailable and the phytates are reduced.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Lean_Meats\">Lean Meats<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19992\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Lean-Meats.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19992\" class=\"wp-image-19992 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Lean-Meats.webp\" alt=\"What\u2019s Good For Acid Reflux\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19992\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lean Meats<\/p><\/div>\n<p>For some, meat can trigger acid reflux because it\u2019s high in proteins, hence harder to digest. This means that your meat-based dinner sits longer in the stomach, putting pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) for a longer period of time. This is particularly true for red meats. If you have acid reflux, avoid beef, pork, lamb and mutton.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, choose lean proteins, like fish and poultry. Shellfish like crab, lobster, scallops, and shrimp are good options too. Substitute ground turkey for ground beef to still enjoy your favorite casseroles, tacos and stews. If your reflux still persists, try switching to plant based proteins like tofu, soy foods and sprouts to see if you notice any difference in your GERD <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/symptoms-of-acid-reflux\/\">symptoms <\/a>and frequency.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Non-Citrus_Fruits\">Non-Citrus Fruits<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19993\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Non-Citrus-Fruits.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19993\" class=\"wp-image-19993 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Non-Citrus-Fruits.webp\" alt=\"What\u2019s Good For Acid Reflux\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19993\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Non-Citrus Fruits<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Highly acidic in nature, citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit and tangerine are common GERD triggers. It\u2019s best to avoid them as well as citrus fruit juices, like your morning favorite \u2013 OJ.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy other non-citrus fruits like bananas, melon, cantaloupe, berries and watermelon for a healthy snack. Feel free to make homemade juices and smoothies with these fruits blended with some dark leafy greens.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Baked_Roasted_Foods\">Baked &amp; Roasted Foods<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19994\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Baked-Roasted-Foods.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19994\" class=\"wp-image-19994 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Baked-Roasted-Foods.webp\" alt=\"What\u2019s Good For Acid Reflux\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19994\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Baked &amp; Roasted Foods<\/p><\/div>\n<p>French fries, chicken nuggets and fried chicken are high-fat foods that worsen reflux because they can delay gastric emptying, exerting extra pressure on the stomach and the LES.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of frying, opt for baking, poaching, grilling or roasting your favorite vegetables and meat recipes.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Low-Fat_Dairy_Products\">Low-Fat Dairy Products<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19995\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Low-Fat-Dairy-Products.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19995\" class=\"wp-image-19995 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Low-Fat-Dairy-Products.webp\" alt=\"What\u2019s Good For Acid Reflux\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19995\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Low-Fat Dairy Products<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Dairy products are high in saturated fats, which delay the emptying of the stomach and increase pressure on the LES.<\/p>\n<p>If full-fat milk and cheese are a problem, you can swap them for their low-fat versions to see if they improve your acid reflux symptoms. Try plant-based milks like soy milk, almond milk, coconut milk or cashew milk for your morning coffee instead, though these are also good to cook with. Love cheese too much to give it up completely? No problem\u2026just make sure that you eat a little cheese in the beginning of your meal instead of a big cheese plate at the end.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dehydrated_Versions_of_Onion_Garlic\">Dehydrated Versions of Onion &amp; Garlic<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_19996\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Dehydrated-Versions-of-Onion-Garlic.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19996\" class=\"wp-image-19996 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Dehydrated-Versions-of-Onion-Garlic.webp\" alt=\"What\u2019s Good For Acid Reflux\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-19996\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dehydrated Versions of Onion &amp; Garlic<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Both garlic and onion may add great flavor to your meats and vegetables, but these are common acid reflux triggers.

Try a pesto or spinach sauce for your pasta; I guarantee you \u2013 they\u2019re delicious!

Make sure there\u2019s a good 3 to 4-hour gap before you go to bed, as this can greatly help in keeping acid reflux symptoms at bay. If you have trouble keeping your intake in check, a good trick is to drink a glass of water after every alcoholic beverage you consume to help moderate consumption. In any case, avoid all carbonated beverages and fruit juices as mixtures.<\/p>\n<p>We highly recommend that you start a food diary to identify your specific GERD triggers and work to eliminate only these from your diet. Also, the permanent solution to acid reflux is to increase production of good quality stomach acid so that you can digest all kinds of food well. Working with a holistic practitioner and including digestive enzymes as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/raft-forming-alginates-for-gerd\/\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">raft-forming alginates<\/a> will go a long way towards fixing your digestion. Remember, the key to sticking to a healthy diet is to eat a variety of foods, so that you don\u2019t get bored with the same food on your plate day after day!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In This Article1 Easy-To-Digest Grains2 Lean Meats3 Non-Citrus Fruits4 Baked &amp; Roasted Foods5 Low-Fat Dairy Products6 Dehydrated Versions of Onion &amp; Garlic7 Fresh Herbs For Flavor8 Dip Blended With Natural Herbs9 Pesto, Spinach Or White Sauce10 Dark Chocolates11 Cold-Pressed Juices &amp; Iced Teas12 Herbal Tea Or Green Tea13 An Occasional Drink Won&#8217;t Harm Too Much [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":24,"featured_media":20004,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[14,23,24],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What\u2019s Good For Acid Reflux?
