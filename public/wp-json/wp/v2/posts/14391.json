Given that it is a highly complex condition, you need a customized PCOD diet plan that focuses on correcting the underlying hormonal imbalances associated with this condition.<\/p>\n<p>Most modern health problems are the result of an imbalance in the body\u2019s physiological foundations.\u00a0My nutrition philosophy is based on the tenets of holistic nutrition and focuses on rebalancing and solidifying your physiological foundations.\u00a0Based on the specific needs of PCOD patients and my nutrition philosophy, I have created a customized PCOD diet plan for Sepalika\u2019s 5-petal program. Let me share some reasons why you need a customized plan like this one in your fight against PCOD.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Help_in_identifying_harmful_foods\">Help in identifying harmful foods<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Our modern diet has brought a lot of adverse effects, without us realizing them. These adverse effects show up differently in different people: In your case, it\u2019s in the form of PCOD. Our PCOD diet plan aims to reverse the adverse effects of our modern diets. During the course of your PCOD program, I will educate you to identify the toxic nonsense that big corporations and diet establishments have been marketing as \u2018food.\u2019 Specifically, I have made a list of foods, which are particularly harmful to PCOD patients.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Detailed_nutritional_guidelines\">Detailed nutritional guidelines<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Our PCOD diet plan includes detailed guidelines on foods you need to stay away from or have in moderation to recover from this hormonal disorder. For example, many PCOD patients are confused about whether coffee is good for them. Our PCOD diet plan advises you on how many cups of coffee you can have in a day, what kind of milk you should use, and which are the acceptable sweeteners.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"List_of_helpful_rules\">List of helpful rules<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Our nutrition plan is not restricted to diet alone. We also include tips that will allow you to get the most of your PCOD diet. For example, a simple tip like \u2018stop eating after second burp\u2019 will prevent you from overeating. As a result, there will be a lesser load on your body to digest the food. There are lots of other similar easy-to-follow rules for optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Comprehensive_purchase_and_storage_guidelines\">Comprehensive purchase and storage guidelines<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The right PCOD diet is not about the ingredients alone. You may be eating the most PCOD-friendly foods, but if they are not washed properly, they will do you more harm than good. Likewise, there\u2019s a lot of useful tips that you need to keep in mind while purchasing groceries. For example, our PCOD diet plan includes guidelines on what salt you should buy, where and how should you store your oils and fats, what type of milk is beneficial for you, etc.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Advice_for_all_meals_of_the_day\">Advice for all meals of the day<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Our PCOD diet plan includes advice for all meals of the day, right from breakfast to dinner. There\u2019s also a lot of interesting ideas for healthy and delicious snacks. We understand that to sustain a diet plan, you need to eat foods that are enjoyable. Keeping that in mind, we have also included a list of acceptable desserts (made using acceptable sweeteners.) This is very different from boring and unsustainable diet plans that most of us are used to.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Learn_to_trust_your_natural_intelligence\"><strong>Learn to trust your natural intelligence<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>An ideal diet plan doesn\u2019t focus on the short term. It trains you to develop healthy habits, which should last a lifetime. Our PCOD diet plan trains you to recognize and trust your innate intelligence, as it speaks to you about your body\u2019s nutritional needs. You will come to see that your body is able to bounce back, heal and repair, without fad diets, yo-yo diets, or other extremely restrictive diets. Together, you will move forward by going back to a time where food was real, whole, nutrient-dense, restorative, tasty and properly prepared.<\/p>\n<p>To conclude, this is the first of its kind PCOD diet plan. Along with a diet plan, Sepalika\u2019s 5-petal PCOD program includes fun exercise videos, ayurvedic supplements, magnetic acupressure kit, and lifestyle tips.<\/p>\n<p>Sign up for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos-treatment-plan\/\">Sepalika&#8217;s 5-Petal PCOD treatment plan<\/a> and take your first step towards a PCOD-free life.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
