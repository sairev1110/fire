According to Encyclopedia.com, the oldest known text specifically on acupuncture points, the\u00a0<em>Systematic Classic of Acupuncture<\/em>, dates back to 282 A.D acupressure for pcos<\/p>\n<p>Acupressure is the non-invasive form of acupuncture, which uses \u201cpressure\u201d applied by magnets, fingers, or seeds instead of needles. By stimulating certain points on the body, especially on the hands and feet, acupressure is able to help the human body re-balance itself.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Magnet acutherapy is the science of using magnets to gently stimulate points on energy meridians to balance and heal imbalances in the human body. The acupressure therapist studies energy meridians for years to learn how to tell which ones are out of balance and which magnets need to be placed where to correct this imbalance and heal disease.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Science_Behind_Magnet_Acutherapy\">The Science Behind Magnet Acutherapy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>At first, it seems a little hard to believe that magnet acutherapy works. Even practitioners who have use points on energy meridians every day struggle to explain how it really works. Honestly, after a point, I can\u2019t explain it either. However, as hundreds of my patients can testify, what\u2019s more important is that it works.<\/p>\n<p>One of my clients who suffered from pre-menstrual pain and periods that left her with no energy told me once \u201cThere were days I&#8217;d be so low on energy that getting out of bed was an ordeal. The first period after the magnetic treatment was a breeze and I felt I&#8217;d been touched by a magic wand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, after all these years of practicing magnet acutherapy, I still find the \u201cmagic wand\u201d may well be the best explanation as to how it works.<\/p>\n<p>That said, there are thousands of studies on National Institutes of Health, the official U.S. government website that publishes scientific papers, that testify that acupuncture works. Discovered and codified by Chinese doctors and seers, energy meridians are at the core of our health. While many of them, as plotted by these ancient scientists run parallel to several physical structures in the body, such as blood vessels, muscles, and lymph systems, they are not the same. According to the principles of acupuncture, life energy is \u201c\u2026more than material structures. It exists as the foundation of all physical structures in the body and governs how they function.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-facts\/\">12 Surprising PCOS Facts You Probably Didn\u2019t Know<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Magnet_Acutherapy_For_PCOS_How_Does_It_Work\">Magnet Acutherapy For PCOS: How Does It Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If a woman\u2019s hormones are in balance, she will likely be in good health. Hormones and the monthly period cycle play a crucial role in a woman\u2019s well being. Medical science knows that women with PCOD often have excessive male hormones. The link between being overweight and\/or having insulin resistance and having PCOD is also clearly established. Magnet acutherapy is able to address all of these problems by addressing the underlying energy networks that govern these functions.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Women fix these small magnets to certain points on their hands using simple micropore tape. The magnets have to be used for 8-10 hours every day and many women prefer to do this at night, after dinner. As they sleep, the magnets do their magic!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a short video that explains how to use magnets.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UqUs4uKd4zE?rel=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Magnet_Acutherapy_Protocol_One_Size_Does_Not_Fit_All\">Magnet Acutherapy Protocol: One Size Does Not Fit All<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>No two women are completely identical in their PCOD. It is a syndrome that has multiple symptoms across multiple body systems. While many women who have PCOD may struggle with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-weight-gain-connection\/\">weight gain<\/a>, not all of them need to be overweight. Thin PCOD exists. Again, women with PCOD often have problems ovulating and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/getting-pregnant-with-pcos\/\">getting pregnant<\/a>, but this does not apply to all PCOD patients. Many women are able to get pregnant with PCOD. Symptoms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-hair-loss\/\">hair loss<\/a>, excessive body hair, etc. too are not universal to PCOD.<\/p>\n<p>Even the most typical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-symptoms\/\">PCOD symptoms<\/a>, irregular periods is not definitive to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-diagnosis\/\">diagnose PCOD<\/a>. That is why a thorough intake of your specific symptoms is needed before the therapist can determine what will work for you.\u00a0There are even women who have regular periods and yet have PCOD-like symptoms.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What this means is that the magnet acutherapy protocol is different for every woman. While the broad principles of diagnosis and choice of points may be similar, the points that help you reverse your PCOD symptoms may not work as well for your friend.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Based upon how well you progress, the therapist may even need to change your magnet acutherapy protocol over the period of your treatment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-and-diet\/\">PCOS And Diet: A Master Guide For Eating Right<\/a><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Acupressure_Without_Magnets_Start_Dealing_with_PCOD_today\">Acupressure Without Magnets: Start Dealing with PCOD today!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When magnets are used regularly as prescribed by a qualified therapist, acupressure is able to deliver accurate and efficient results.

You can press these points <u>on both feet<\/u> for 30 seconds to 1 minute twice a day. Within 30-45 days, you can begin to notice improvements in your symptoms. These points are derived from the principles of Chinese Acupressure and Reflexology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ovaries:<\/strong> This acupressure region is on the outer side of the foot, just below the ankle bone. Press the shaded area <u>on both feet<\/u> with your thumb or any other finger using medium pressure for 30 seconds to 1 minute, twice every day. If you find any particularly painful area, spend a little time on it, reducing the amount of pressure, but pressing for longer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Uterus<\/strong>: This acupressure area is the mirror image of the Ovaries area. By massaging this area, again for 30 seconds to 1 minute a day, the flow of energy to the uterus is stimulated. Once again, if you are a woman who experiences pain during her periods, you will likely find tender spots here. Work on them gently and as you do this over a couple of weeks, you may find that those areas don&#8217;t hurt as much. That is a good sign, that the underlying energy imbalance is being corrected.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_20458\" style=\"width: 665px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Accupressure-2nd-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20458\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20458\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Accupressure-2nd-image.webp\" alt=\"acupressure for pcos\" width=\"655\" height=\"380\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20458\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">acupressure for pcos<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_20459\" style=\"width: 716px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Accupressure-3rd-image.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-20459\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20459\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Accupressure-3rd-image.webp\" alt=\"acupressure for pcos\" width=\"706\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-20459\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">acupressure for pcos<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Lymphatic drainage<\/strong>: Many women face <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/pcos-bloating\/\">bloating<\/a>, swelling, cramping, spasms, etc. around their periods because the Gut-Related Lymph Vessels get congested around the onset of the period.
