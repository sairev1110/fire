However, each body is unique and sometimes that means the egg quality isn\u2019t always the best in some. Because of this, if a woman is trying to become pregnant, it can be very difficult for her to do so. Thankfully, there are a few ways that one can use to improve egg quality for natural <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/can-pcos-ovulate-regularly\/\" target=\"_blank\">ovulation<\/a>. This article will explore more important information about ovulation and some all-natural methods you can use to help improve it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_Ovulation\"><strong>What is Ovulation?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ovulation is a natural process in females that causes mature eggs to be released from the ovaries. Once they are, the eggs are then sent to the Fallopian tube where they await fertilisation. If no fertilisation happens within 3 days, in about 30-40 days from the last period, the lining of the uterus (where the Fallopian tube is) will break down, causing a release of blood, better known as menstruation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"The_Typical_100-Day-Cycle_of_an_Egg\"><strong>The Typical\n100-Day-Cycle of an Egg<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might not seem like it, ovulation is a very complicated process. The typical 100-day-cycle of an egg includes the eggs maturing for most of that time in the ovary, being released from it into the Fallopian tube on the day of ovulation and finally being stored in the Fallopian tube until they either are naturally destroyed or fertilised within. Regardless of which occurs, eggs have a very short lifespan which ranges from about 12 to 24 hours. While an egg lifespan might be short, the overall cycle of things takes a little more than three months. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"When_Natural_Ovulation_Gets_Disturbed\"><strong>When Natural Ovulation Gets Disturbed<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different reasons why natural ovulation might become disturbed. This could range from your body not creating enough hormones to you being very stressed. When your body experiences these changes, natural ovulation eventually becomes disturbed because your body is not functioning in the way it should. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Common_Problems_that_Cause_Lower_Egg_Quality_in_Women\"><strong>Common Problems that Cause Lower Egg Quality in Women<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the reason for lower egg quality in women will vary, there are a few common causes of them. Below are some of the most frequent things that create this problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Stress\"><strong>Stress<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Stress.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21017\"\/><figcaption>Stress<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stress is a huge factor of why natural ovulation can get disturbed. It can cause your body to be on high alert. This can eventually lead to the cortisol hormone, which is needed for healthy fertility, to decrease in your body. Stress can also cause you to have a tougher pregnancy or harder time becoming pregnant because it puts more pressure on your body.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Illnesses\"><strong>Illnesses<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Illnesses.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21016\"\/><figcaption>Illnesses<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another common cause of poor egg quality is the presence of some health conditions. This is especially so if you suffer from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Polycystic (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/treat-pcos-naturally-inspiring-success-story\/\" target=\"_blank\">Polycystic<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/treat-pcos-naturally-inspiring-success-story\/\"> Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)<\/a>. This condition often increases your male hormone levels which causes natural ovulation to practically disappear. Chronic illnesses, such as cancer, can also hurt your egg quality. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Smoking\"><strong>Smoking<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Smoking.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21015\"\/><figcaption>Smoking<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Smoking not only destroys your lungs, but it can ruin your natural ovulation cycle. In fact, it\u2019s believed that about 13% of infertility cases are due to smoking. Cigarette smoke can destroy the eggs. Because a woman is born with all the eggs she will have in her lifetime, the smoke will quickly diminish their number. This can lead to unhealthy eggs and a sporadic ovulation cycle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Idiopathic_Problems\"><strong>Idiopathic Problems<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Idiopathic-Problems.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21014\"\/><figcaption>Idiopathic Problems<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes there isn\u2019t a known cause of why your ovulation cycle is not normal. It could just be that this is your body\u2019s norm. While it can be a difficult diagnosis to hear from your doctor, &nbsp;there are a few ways you can increase your chances for better egg quality for natural ovulation, like watching your diet and exercising. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Age\"><strong>Age<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Age.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21013\"\/><figcaption>Age<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another common cause of lower egg quality is your age. Once you hit forty, your natural ovulation cycle starts to slow down. This can hurt your egg quality and even cause your ovulation cycle to disappear. However, this isn\u2019t to stay that everyone\u2019s egg quality will decline once they hit this age. Sometimes this is based on genetics and one\u2019s natural ovulation cycle might end up lasting much longer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Endometriosis\"><strong>Endometriosis<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Endometriosis.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21012\"\/><figcaption>Endometriosis<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/obgyn.ucla.edu\/endometriosis\" target=\"_blank\">Endometriosis<\/a> is a disorder where the tissues that are meant to be on inside of your ovarian system end up growing on the exterior of it. This is not only painful but can ruin the lining of your uterus and the Fallopian tubes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/chocolate-cyst-endometrioma\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"This eventually can hurt your egg quality and cause infertility.  (opens in a new tab)\">This eventually can hurt your egg quality and cause infertility. <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Excessive_Production_of_Prolactin\"><strong>Excessive Production of Prolactin<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Excessive-Production-of-Prolactin.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21011\"\/><figcaption>Excessive Production of Prolactin<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While some might have a lack of hormones, others might have too much of them, especially of Prolactin. This hormone is created by the pituitary gland and can eventually cause your Estrogen levels to lower. Because of this, it can hurt your natural ovulation cycle. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Natural_Solutions_for_Better_Ovulation\"><strong>Natural Solutions for Better Ovulation<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, there are a handful of natural solutions you can use to improve your egg quality for ovulation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Reduce_Your_Stress_Levels\"> <strong>Reduce Your Stress Levels<\/strong> <\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Reduce-Your-Stress-Levels.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21010\"\/><figcaption>Reduce Your Stress Levels <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While easier said than done, reducing stress is vital when it comes to improving egg quality. There are various methods you can use to reduce stress. You can try to release tension by working out or doing yoga. This will eventually help your cortisol levels to balance out which can increase fertility. Another way to reduce stress is to just relax. You can light a soothing candle, listen to some calming music, or take a bath. You can also try to work on doing deep breathing. This can help to activate your parasympathetic nervous system which controls your body\u2019s relaxation levels. Deep breathing also works to slow your heart rate which allows you to naturally relax. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Eat_Food_That_Is_High_In_Antioxidants\"> <strong>Eat Food That Is High In Antioxidants<\/strong> <\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Eat-Food-That-Is-High-In-Antioxidants.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21009\"\/><figcaption>Eat Food That Is High In Antioxidants <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Antioxidants are vital to consume if you want to improve your egg quality. Healthy eggs need vitamins in order to survive. Antioxidants help to provide them with these vitamins and minerals. Some food choices to consider consuming to help with this include blueberries, cherries, pecans, kidney beans, and goji berries. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Reduce_Your_Intake_Of_Sugar_And_Salt\"><strong>Reduce Your Intake Of Sugar And Salt<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Reduce-Your-Intake-Of-Sugar-And-Salt.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21008\"\/><figcaption>Reduce Your Intake Of Sugar And Salt<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sugar and factory-processed table salt are the nemeses of anyone who wants to enhance their egg quality. These two items can cause many health issues, including chronic diseases. Sugar and salt also can wreak havoc on your liver which can cause it to overwork trying to filter through these particles. When your body focuses on trying to remove them, it can cause your egg quality to decline. This is due to it not producing enough hormones and\/or not retaining vitamins and minerals needed for healthy eggs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Drink_Plenty_Of_Water\"><strong>Drink Plenty Of Water<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Drink-Plenty-Of-Water.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21007\"\/><figcaption>Drink Plenty Of Water<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying hydrated is key to ensuring that you have good egg quality. Because your body needs water to survive, staying hydrated helps to keep you healthy. This in return ensures your body is able to function properly. Water also helps your body to filter through vitamins and minerals which can encourage healthy egg production. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Exercise\"><strong>Exercise<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Exercise.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21006\"\/><figcaption>Exercise<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While sometimes extreme workouts can cause more harm than good to your body, s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/aviva-method-for-pcos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"imple workouts can be very beneficial (opens in a new tab)\">imple workouts can be very beneficial<\/a>. They not only can reduce stress but help your body function normally. This can result in better egg quality.  Some of the best exercises to encourage natural ovulation are light jogging, Pilates, yoga, and even just a simple walk around the block. By getting up and keeping your body moving, it helps to keep your eggs healthy and encourage normal ovulation cycles.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Watch_Your_Intake_Of_Hidden_Chemicals\"><strong>Watch Your Intake Of Hidden Chemicals<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Watch-Your-Intake-Of-Hidden-Chemicals.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21005\"\/><figcaption>Watch Your Intake Of Hidden Chemicals<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might not realise it, but you consume or come into contact with dangerous chemicals daily. This can be through pesticides on the food you eat or with BPA that coats the plastic containers storing your food or makeup. In fact, plenty of studies have been done that prove pesticides can be very harmful toward reproductive health. This is because they block the Estrogen receptor which is necessary for healthy fertility. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Consume_Plenty_Of_Fish_Oil\"><strong>Consume Plenty Of Fish Oil<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Consume-Plenty-Of-Fish-Oil.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21004\"\/><figcaption>Consume Plenty Of Fish Oil<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fish oil is high in Omega-3s which have been proven to help fertility. It\u2019s believed that fish oil will not only improve your egg quality but help to prolong your reproductive lifespan. This is because it enhances the oocyte quality which prevents your ovaries from quickly ageing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Eat_Herbs\"> <strong>Eat Herbs<\/strong> <\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"704\" height=\"340\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Eat-Herbs.webp\" alt=\"Improve your egg quality\" class=\"wp-image-21002\"\/><figcaption>Eat Herbs<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While you need to be careful with consuming certain herbs if you have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/false-unicorn-root-fertility\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"medical issues, many of them can be very beneficial.  (opens in a new tab)\">medical issues, many of them can be very beneficial. <\/a>Dandelion is a great choice for fertility as it\u2019s high in Vitamins A and C. It also works to cleanse the liver which helps to remove toxins from your body. Red clover is another powerful herb to use for egg quality. Because of its high vitamin levels, it easily helps to improve natural ovulation. Another choice to consider is maca, a type of ginseng. It is used quite a bit for fertility treatments which means it will help your egg quality. Maca also helps to improve your chances of getting pregnant. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might seem like it\u2019s impossible to improve your egg quality for natural ovulation, it\u2019s not. There are plenty of natural methods you can use to improve your egg quality for natural ovulation. So, if you\u2019re looking for some easy and all-natural ways to help with this, definitely keep the tips mentioned above in mind. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Want To Explore More?
