She found a bottle of the liquid antacid she was desperately looking for. She gulped a couple spoonful of the soothing liquid. Relief came almost instantly. She would sleep. For tonight.

Heartburn happens when acidic contents of the stomach reflux back into the esophagus and inflame its sensitive lining. This leads to a burning sensation in the esophagus. Antacids contain alkaline chemicals that will neutralize the acid. Some antacids also contain anti-flatulent activity, meaning that a chemical in the antacid eliminates excess gas formation.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Should_You_Use_OTC_Antacids\">How Should You Use OTC Antacids?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Liquid forms of antacids work faster than tablets.<a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/ency\/patientinstructions\/000198.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Antacids should be taken for heartburn<\/a> that occurs once in a while.

In fact, it is not advisable to take antacids for more than six weeks straight.<\/p>\n<p>But we often tend to disregard these instructions and use antacids indiscriminately, because (a) we want immediate symptomatic relief, and (b) we do not understand the real cause of acid reflux and do not know how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/acid-reflux-treatment-in-ayurveda\/\">treat it at the root<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Taking antacids for more than the prescribed duration can cause what is known as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1500660\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rebound hyperacidity.<\/a>\u201d Here the body tries to compensate for the constant neutralization of its stomach acid by producing more amounts of acid, thereby making your acid reflux even worse. This creates a vicious cycle where overuse of antacids makes your heartburn worse and you take more antacids to get relief. This causes dependence on antacids that may have precarious consequences in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Antacids that contain aluminum can cause a variety of health complications including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/acid-reflux-and-constipation\/\">constipation<\/a>, osteomalacia and hypophosphatemia.<\/p>\n<p>Magnesium-containing antacids can cause diarrhea due to their laxative effect.
