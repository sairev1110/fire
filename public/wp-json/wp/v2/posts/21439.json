But like all things related to pregnancy, there is usually more to the story if you look beneath the surface. In this article, we\u2019re going to talk about AMH, how it can affect your pregnancy and what you can do to improve your chances of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/fertility\/unexplained-infertility-get-pregnant-naturally\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">natural pregnancy.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_AMH\">What is AMH?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AMH-300x225.webp\" alt=\"AMH\" class=\"wp-image-21443\"\/><figcaption>AMH<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/30299431\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AMH<\/a> is a glycoprotein hormone that is produced by granulosa cells in ovarian follicles. These cells \u2018stand guard\u2019 around immature follicle cells. So, by measuring the amount of AMH secretion, doctors estimate how many immature follicles are remaining in a lady\u2019s ovaries. The production of AMH is therefore indirectly correlated to fertility potential. AMH is a way to indirectly determine your egg count, and doctors use AMH as a test to determine how many future years a woman may remain fertile for.<br><br>AMH declines as one ages. While it is common for AMH to start declining around age 35, it is not uncommon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/fertility\/getting-pregnant-after-35-you-can-do-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">for women in their late 30s to get pregnant<\/a>, and there are cases of women becoming pregnant even in their 40s, even with lowered AMH levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_does_AMH_level_indicate\">What does AMH level indicate?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AMH is measured in ng\/mL, and, as previously mentioned, is associated with one\u2019s fertility. Since AMH naturally declines over time, one must compare a lady\u2019s AMH levels to a benchmark for her age group. Below is a graph of normal AMH levels by age group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"578\" height=\"336\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/image.png\" alt=\"amh chart\" class=\"wp-image-21440\"\/><figcaption>amh chart<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_Ovarian_reserve\">What is Ovarian reserve?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/vector-illustration-female-uterus-flower-frame-isolated-white-background_537078-102-300x300.webp\" alt=\"womens health amh\" class=\"wp-image-21445\"\/><figcaption>womens health amh<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ovarian reserve is defined as the number of eggs remaining in the ovaries. The levels of AMH in the blood correlates to the number of immature eggs in the body and hence AMH is used as a predictor of a woman\u2019s ovarian or egg reserve. As with AMH, ovarian reserve also decreases over time. However, it does not determine the <em>quality<\/em> of the eggs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_happens_when_AMH_levels_are_high\">What happens when AMH levels are high?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/AMH-Levels-300x169.webp\" alt=\"AMH-Levels\" class=\"wp-image-21446\"\/><figcaption>AMH-Levels<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The normal lab range for AMH is 2.2 -3.9 ng\/ml. High levels of AMH is usually seen in women with PCOS and in certain ovarian tumors like granulosa cell tumors. Elevated levels of AMH may lead one to believe that a woman is more fertile, but this usually isn\u2019t the case. You still only ovulate one egg per month. And you need only one egg to reproduce. AMH levels only matter when you need to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF), as more the number of eggs retrieved, the greater the chances of conception success in IVF. <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0kINwoYjHSU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Watch this video<\/a>&nbsp;on how you can conceive naturally even with low AMH.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"What_happens_if_my_AMH_levels_are_low_Can_I_still_get_pregnant\">What happens if my AMH levels are low?

It is not unheard of for women to give birth in their late 30s or even their 40s, when AMH levels start to decline. Fertility clinics and doctors check AMH for a variety of reasons other than the ability to get pregnant, such as signs of PCOS (for high AMH levels) or menopause (for low AMH levels). <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/30299431\">A 20<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/30299431\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/30299431\">8 study<\/a> showed that there was no association between low AMH and fertility, even when adjusting for age.

Low AMH levels can be early signs of premature ovarian failure or menopause. While the chances to conceive aren\u2019t zero, it can be significantly more difficult to become pregnant if you have low AMH levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Root_Cause_and_Natural_Treatment_for_Low_AMH\">Root Cause and Natural Treatment for Low AMH?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Low AMH, like many conditions, can be treated. There are several root causes of low AMH: poor ovarian health, low thyroid hormone function, lack of proper nutrients in one\u2019s diet, and chronic inflammation. Changing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/fertility\/getting-pregnant-your-foundational-health-is-most-important\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one\u2019s diet, lifestyle, and use of supplements<\/a> can help significantly overcome low AMH levels for natural pregnancy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Poor_Ovarian_Health\">Poor Ovarian Health<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"670\" height=\"285\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/female-egg-count-by-age-670x285-2.png\" alt=\"female egg count amh\" class=\"wp-image-21456\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/fertility\/getting-pregnant-your-foundational-health-is-most-important\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Several health conditions<\/a> can affect the ovaries. Thankfully, these can be detected through comprehensive hormone testing. Conditions such as PCOS, luteal phase deficiency, premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), and poor egg quality assessed by AMH (although controversial) are some factors that lead to poor ovarian health. PCOS is the leading factor and can be present in cases where AMH is high. This is because PCOS leads the ovaries to produce an excessive number of androgens, which can disrupt fertility in women and keep many follicles in a half-mature stage, leading to high AMH in testing.<br><br>Luteal phase deficiency is defined as a shorter luteal phase (days from ovulation to bleeding), which is typically between 13-14 days, and can definitely create a less than ideal environment for pregnancy.<br><br>POI is defined as when your ovaries shut down hormone production at an early age (typically before 40). These conditions can often be improved by addressing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/fertility\/getting-pregnant-your-foundational-health-is-most-important\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">foundational health of the woman<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Low_Thyroid_Hormone_Function\">Low Thyroid Hormone Function<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-medium\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Low-Thyroid-Hormone-Function-300x200.webp\" alt=\"Low-Thyroid-Hormone-Function amh\" class=\"wp-image-21448\"\/><figcaption>Low-Thyroid-Hormone-Function amh<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The communication between your hormones and brain (specifically the hypothalamus and pituitary glands) can affect hormone levels in the body and lead to low AMH. <a href=\"https:\/\/thyroidresearchjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13044-021-00112-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Low thyroid hormones can affect ovarian reserve<\/a> measurements and fertility by affecting the process of follicular growth.

One of the biggest drivers for infertility is a diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates. This prompts insulin production, which can drive inflammation, oxidative stress, and other conditions down the line that can not only affect your AMH levels but even the chances of you getting pregnant.
