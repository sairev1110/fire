Eventually, the sugar-processing systems of our body give up, resulting in high insulin resistance and high blood glucose.<\/p>\n<p>Then begins the lifelong struggle of \u201cmanaging blood sugar levels\u201d with medications.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these medications do little to fix the sugar overload problem &#8211; all they do is mask it. Type-2 Diabetes is an environmentally-driven condition \u2013 only diet and lifestyle will reverse it, not medications which only treat the symptoms. So, can you reverse type 2 diabetes? Yes, you sure can! Lets dig in to find out ways on how to reverse type 2 diabetes.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Eliminate_The_Cause\"><span id=\"Eliminate_The_Cause\">Eliminate The Cause<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The might of the processed food lobby can be gauged from the fact that American Diabetes Association\u00a0while promoting a careful watch on fats and the glycemic index of foods (the speed at which different foods turn to glucose in our body), does not have much to say about processed carbs. They advocate keeping blood sugar balanced, through regular carbohydrate intake, that is then dealt with by medications which have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/type-2-diabetes-drugs-side-effects\/\">side effects<\/a> when used over the long term.<\/p>\n<p>Why would we not just take away the cause, take the load off the pancreas, allow the body to heal itself back to balance and do away with the meds?<\/p>\n<div class=\"col-md-12 arti-subsc\">\n<div class=\"subscriberow\">[mc4wp_form id=&#8221;12950&#8243;]<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2 id=\"3_Steps_to_Freedom\"><span id=\"3_Steps_to_Freedom\">3 Steps to Freedom!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If T2D is a disease where our body can\u2019t eliminate the heavy load of sugars from our diet effectively it stands to reason that the way out should be simple enough. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/reversing-diabetes-doctors-show-how-possible\/\">Reversing type 2 diabetes<\/a> without medication isn&#8217;t easy but it certainly is achievable with the right amount of discipline and a positive attitude towards health and life.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don\u2019t put the sugar in (change your diet)<\/li>\n<li>Burn off what\u2019s already in (exercise and fasting)<\/li>\n<li>Stress Less, Sleep More (create an anti-inflammatory internal environment)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 id=\"STEP_1_Dont_Put_The_Sugar_in_Change_Your_Diet\"><span id=\"STEP_1_Dont_Put_The_Sugar_in_Change_Your_Diet\">STEP 1: Don\u2019t Put The Sugar in \u2013 Change Your Diet<\/span><\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18795\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/1-1.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18795\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18795\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/1-1.webp\" alt=\"Can you reverse Type 2 Diabetes\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18795\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Can you reverse Type 2 Diabetes<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In order to do this, we need to understand where the sugar comes from. Yes, we all know that the sneaky chocolate bar, soft drink and cookie contribute sweetness and sugar, but what we forget about (or don\u2019t know) is that all the starchy food you consume during the day \u2013 bread, cereal, rice, crackers, pasta, potatoes &#8211; also breaks down into glucose (sugar).<strong> It\u2019s actually these processed carbs that contribute to most of the sugar load in your diet leading to increased blood sugar and weight gain.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The optimum strategy is to eat little or no refined carbohydrates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But Then, What\u2019s Left to Eat?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What happens if you remove the blood sugar-raising foods?

A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/CD002968\/ENDOC_exercise-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cochrane Review<\/a> compiling data from fourteen different studies assessing the effect of exercise on type-2 diabetes concluded, \u201c<strong>exercise improves blood sugar control and this effect is evident even without weight loss.<\/strong>\u00a0Furthermore, exercise decreases body fat content, thus the failure to lose weight with exercise programs is probably explained by the conversion of fat to muscle. Exercise improved the body\u2019s reaction to insulin and decreased blood lipids\u201d.<\/p>\n<p id=\"Regular_Meals_Or_Regular_Fasting\"><strong>Regular Meals or Regular Fasting?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The American Diabetes Association advocates people to \u201cspace meals evenly through the day and not skip meals\u201d. They promote the theory that spreading out foods, especially carb-containing foods, over three meals each day (plus several small snacks a day) can help maintain steady blood sugar levels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sadly, these guidelines seem to serve the medical practitioners more than the patients<\/strong>. When patients are on diabetes medications, their blood sugar levels can be more easily monitored and the medication dosage and timing more conveniently adjusted, if the blood sugar levels are kept relatively high through regular meals through the day.<\/p>\n<p>This approach does little to combat the underlying cause of the disease itself \u2013 which is too high an intake of dietary sugar, that then can\u2019t be processed by the body naturally.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If instead, we choose to keep our blood glucose lower, by reducing the sugar load and allow our body to take back control and settle back into balance, then we shouldn\u2019t require the medications.<\/strong> Our blood sugar should regain balance through natural processes and a short time without food should be more than manageable and in fact, beneficial.<\/p>\n<p>One of the ways we can help our body to reset itself is intermittent fasting. Celebrity BBC Anchor and diabetes expert Michael Mosley, M.D., reports that this way of eating effectively mimics the eating habits of our ancestors.<\/p>\n<div class=\"arti-addon\">RELATED: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/type-2-diabetes-exercise\/\">Type 2 Diabetes Exercise \u2013 Does It Really Work ?<\/a><\/div>\n<p>Research shows that fasting produces a number of biochemical benefits, including improved insulin sensitivity, lowered triglycerides, weight loss and reduced sugar cravings.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/intensivedietarymanagement.com\/fix-broken-metabolism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jason Fung, M.D.,<\/a> fasting is a simple and speedy way to force your body to burn off stored sugar for use as energy, maximally lower insulin and ignite the flames of fat burning. Research suggests that restricting daily eating to a specific window of time, such as an eight- to twelve-hour window (i.e. 8am -8pm) allows the body to shift over from burning sugar to burning fat as its primary fuel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We are not advocating a \u201ccold turkey\u201d approach to this big change, especially if you are on medications. Nor are we saying you should throw your medicines away. We\u2019re saying that the doctors who are achieving fantastic results in reversing diabetes using this common sense approach seem to know something the others don\u2019t.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The transition to periods of fasting may need to be undertaken slowly and always, in conjunction with a whole food (unprocessed food) diet. Always consult your doctor prior to starting a fast if you are taking prescription medications.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"STEP_3_Stress_Less_Sleep_More\"><span id=\"STEP_3_Stress_Less_Sleep_More\">STEP 3: Stress Less, Sleep More<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Address any underlying emotional issues or external stressors and get 7-8 hours sleep per night. Insufficient sleep appears to raise stress and blood sugar, encouraging insulin resistance and weight gain. A 10-year long study published in Diabetes Care in 2003 that had followed 70,000 diabetes-free women, found that women who slept less than five hours or more than nine hours each night were 34 percent more likely to develop diabetes symptoms than women who slept seven to eight hours each night.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Make_Up_for_Any_Dietary_Insufficiencies\"><span id=\"Make_Up_for_Any_Dietary_Insufficiencies\">Make Up for Any Dietary Insufficiencies<\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimize your vitamin D levels<\/strong> &#8211; Recent studies have revealed that getting enough <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/vitamin-d-and-diabetes\/\">vitamin D<\/a> can have a powerful effect on normalizing your blood pressure and blood glucose and that low vitamin D levels may increase the risk of diabetes.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize your gut flora<\/strong> \u2013 Our gut bacteria can have an influence on inflammation, insulin resistance and appetite control and balancing gut bacteria may have a positive influence in diabetes.
