Three times. It just didn\u2019t seem to fit. This was the 5th t-shirt in a month that I had struggled fitting into. I blamed this sudden weight gain on my eating habits. However, this seemed to be a fairly repetitive pattern, and I sensed something was amiss. Though my lifestyle remained fairly similar, the weight didn\u2019t seem so. And soon, my hair fall increased and periods became irregular.\u00a0This was a wake-up call for sure, and one visit to the gynecologist confirmed my doubts. I got diagnosed with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/\">polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)<\/a> sometime in Feb 2017. But that\u2019s not the interesting part. My story on walking for PCOS and the difference it made to my life is where all the action lies.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"My_Wake-Up_Call_Lifestyle_Changes_Are_A_Must_To_Fight_PCOS\">My Wake-Up Call: Lifestyle Changes Are A Must To Fight PCOS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>What followed my PCOS diagnosis was a heavy list of restrictions. Don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t eat this, don\u2019t be this. All of these only stressed me out further, and I kept dodging the necessary lifestyle changes. I did start exercising once a while, but found it hard to keep up with the discipline and gave up.\u00a0Then I did not get my periods for 60 days straight and this freaked me out.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I never made health a priority until I was diagnosed with PCOS. I headed out for a stroll that day and ended up walking for a good half an hour.\u00a0 On my trail, I was struck by the idea of heading for walks every day for 30 days.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It seemed doable and exciting. I was advised to exercise, and brisk walking could easily help me manage PCOS. However, I decided not to limit myself to just walks and spread awareness about the role of lifestyle changes in dealing with PCOS.<\/p>\n<p>And thus began my challenge of walking for PCOS &#8212; 5 kilometers every day for 30 days.\u00a0It was 2nd December 2017, when I started and then I walked the rest of the month for my well being and happiness. Motivation doesn\u2019t come to you easily, particularly when you are working on things alone.\u00a0Hence, I made my cause public on social media. There were two reasons for this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>To keep myself in check through the support of friends and family.<\/li>\n<li>To create awareness and build solidarity for others on my timeline who may be suffering from PCOS but have no clue and seek help at the earliest.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span id=\"Walking_For_PCOS_How_It_Helped_Me_With_Weight_Loss_More\">Walking For PCOS: How It Helped Me With Weight Loss &amp; More<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>My walks have been liberating to say the least. Every day I would look forward to it with enthusiasm. I tried multiple ways to make this an entertaining experience and not let the monotony set in.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also made me more aware of my body. Exercise in any form releases endorphins, commonly known as happy hormones. That\u2019s why you feel charged and cheerful after a workout. Every day, I\u2019d come back home happy and pumped. I would sleep well at night too because of sweating it out earlier in the day.<\/p>\n<p>Some days I walked in parks, some days on footpaths, some days in the morning, some days in the evening. I was so keen to not default on my goal that I ended up walking even in the airport lobby one evening. Barring a couple of days, I managed to pull it through.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>And it showed. I lost 3 kgs as a result. The weight loss has put me in a happier, better place today.\u00a0My stress has alleviated too and I am focusing on doing more things that make me happy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As for the periods, the 60-day gap has reduced and I am on the path of a more regular cycle. My eating habits have changed too. I am conscious of what I eat. I avoid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/quit-your-sweet-addiction\/\">sugar<\/a> and processed food as much as I can and eat home cooked food largely. Now that I have done walks, I\u2019ll probably take up some other form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/exercise-for-pcos\/\">exercise<\/a> soon.

Choose something that you will enjoy and it will be easier to pursue. Walks worked for me. Perhaps you like swimming, Zumba, plain skipping or even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/exercise-to-balance-hormones\/\">dancing<\/a>. Do what makes you happy, just do it.\u00a0Remember it\u2019s easier to achieve small, measurable goals than big, audacious ones.<\/li>\n<li>Restrict sugar intake and processed food as much as you can. Eat local, fresh, and home-cooked food to a large extent.<\/li>\n<li>Do not fret too much about PCOS. It\u2019s a lifestyle-based condition that can easily be controlled through certain modifications to diet and lifestyle.<\/li>\n<li>And most importantly, remember you are not alone in this. A lot of women around you are actually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/pcos\/treat-pcos-naturally-inspiring-success-story\/\">dealing with it<\/a>. Support each other through it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/our-programs\/polycystic-ovary-disorder\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Want To Explore More?
