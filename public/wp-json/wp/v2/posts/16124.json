There\u2019s no getting around the basics, so let\u2019s go over those first.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eat Healthy:<\/strong> Get plenty of green vegetables and fruit. They have natural compounds that support the natural sleep cycle.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get Exercise:<\/strong> As appropriate for your age and health condition. Nothing knocks you out at the end of a day like a good workout during the day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Caffeine And Alcohol:<\/strong> Avoid excessive intake of caffeine and alcohol.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Exposure To Electronics:<\/strong> Avoid exposure to electronics for a couple of hours before bedtime. That late-night TV show may be tempting, but the blue light from the screen can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/mental-health\/sleep-and-mental-health\/\">trick your brain<\/a> into thinking it\u2019s still daytime and rev you up when you should be winding down, contributing to your lack of sleep.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Heavy Meals At Night:<\/strong> Specially those laden with proteins and fats. Your body has to stay up to digest it, and guess what that means for your night of sleep? If it\u2019s a night out and you know you\u2019re going to overdo it, consider using digestive enzymes to give your poor digestive tract a hand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Have A Daily De-stressing Ritual:\u00a0<\/strong>Whether it\u2019s yoga, knitting, music, a warm bath, or whatever else floats your boat, pick something to do that will help you wind down from the stresses of the day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use Some Aromatherapy:<\/strong> Ayurveda recommends massaging dabs of warm oil (sesame seems to work best) on the soles of the feet, the crown of the head, and behind the ear for great sleep.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Gentle_Natural_Sleep_Remedies\">Gentle, Natural Sleep Remedies<\/span><\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_18389\" style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Inflammation-article-2_image1.webp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18389\" class=\"wp-image-18389 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Inflammation-article-2_image1.webp\" alt=\"natural sleep remedies for elderly\" width=\"779\" height=\"309\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-18389\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gentle, Natural Sleep Remedies<\/p><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019re still struggling, even with the basics in place, there are many natural <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/health-tools\/best-supplements-for-sleep\">supplements <\/a>that can help.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember: as universal as sleep is, the reason yours is disturbed could be different from others\u2014 sleep problem apnea, restless leg syndrome, improper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/type-2-diabetes\/14-amazing-herbs-that-lower-blood-sugar\/\">blood sugar <\/a>balance, and the list goes on and on.

We know that\u2019s not happening, even when we take the best care to eat right, because the soil, the crops, and the livestock lack the vitamins and minerals we used to get from them a century ago.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What works for many: a 2-a-day high-quality multi-vitamin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Melatonin\">Melatonin<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This brain hormone is a crucial part of the gentle sleep-wake cycle, peaking at night and going down in the morning. When the sun goes down, were it not for artificial light sleep problem, melatonin would peak naturally in our bodies, signaling to all our systems that it was time to wind down for the night. It decreases naturally with age, making light sleep and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/sleep\/oil-pulling-remedy-insomnia\/\">insomnia<\/a> a feature of old age.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What works for many: 0.3\u20135 mg (start low and increase to a dose that gives you a good night\u2019s rest without a heavy head the next morning)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Valerian\">Valerian<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Most swear by this herb that has been used for centuries to fall asleep and stay asleep.

This makes it fantastic for sleep issues like restless leg syndrome and sleep apnea. And calcium levels naturally peak in our bodies when we sleep; so one way to sleep problem better is to get them to stay high at night.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What works for many: 200 mg of magnesium with 600 mg of calcium<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"5-HTP\">5-HTP<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s a natural precursor to serotonin, the brain chemical that induces a feeling of being safe, satiated, and calm. Those on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/gerd\/sleeping-pills-and-acid-reflux\/\">antidepressant <\/a>or psychotic drugs must consult their doctor before using 5-HTP.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What works for many: 200\u2013400 mg, 45 minutes before bedtime<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Vitamin_C\">Vitamin C<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Sleep apnea can lead to very high levels of free radicals, the rogues that bounce around inside your body and damage cells. This, in turn, leads to oxidative stress and insomnia. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/living-well\/benefits-vitamin-c\/\">Vitamin C<\/a> can help reverse this process and give you that restful sleep that has been eluding you.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What works for many: 1 g (watch out for diarrhea; every person has different stomach tolerance to vitamin C)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"L-Theanine\">L-Theanine<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Literally able to \u201csmoothen\u201d brain waves in research studies, L-theanine is the substance found in tea and used over centuries to achieve deep, restful sleep. It is a great natural sleep remedy with the ability to balance the twin sleep-wake hormones melatonin and serotonin.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What works for many: 200\u2013400 mg (works better when paired with GABA)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"GABA\">GABA<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This amino acid calms over-excited neurons. Insomniacs show consistently lower levels of GABA in lab tests. Studies seem to suggest that GABA does as much for waking tasks like prioritizing planned actions and that it is unlikely to be overdosed since it is self-limiting.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What works for many: 250\u20131,000 mg, 45 minutes before bedtime<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Try these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sepalika.com\/sleep\/how-to-sleep-better\/\">natural sleep remedies<\/a> one at a time (except when recommendations are for synergistic pairs), and let us know what worked for you.
