Strength training and impact exercises such as lifting weights, walking or running can help offset decline in bone mineral density that occurs during and post menopause.<\/p>\n<p>Weight training exercises can be done by anyone. Women just have to adjust the level of difficulty to match their ability. Weight bearing, high impact exercises &#8211; that include dancing, high-impact aerobics, running or sports like badminton, tennis and so on, help increase bone density but are ideally suited for people who are do not have osteoporosis or naturally low bone mass.<\/p>\n<p>Low impact weight\/ strength training or resistance training exercises such as lifting light weights, using elastic bands or weight machines, etc. can be performed by menopausal women diagnosed with osteoporosis, who are looking to build bone density to combat the disease.<\/p>\n<p>Postmenopausal women can include endurance exercises such as aerobics, strength exercises, and balance exercises in their routine. Research has shown that both high impact and low impact exercises are effective in supporting healthy bone mineral density in post menopausal women.<\/p>\n<p>Weight or strength training exercises require simple movements and can be customized to suit a person\u2019s body mass and strength. It is advisable to perform these exercises at least 3 days a week, for at least twenty minutes at a time.
